# LUU-2 Parachute Flare
The LUU-2 parachute flare is an air-launched flare suspended by a parachute used to illuminate the ground during nighttime.

The F-14 can carry up to 16 LUU-2 flares in up to 4 SUU-25 flare dispensers on TERs at stations 4 and 5, each TER capable of carrying up to 2 dispensers in order not to conflict with the fuselage.

The LUU-2 parachute flare is launched and set up in the same way as a general-purpose bomb.
