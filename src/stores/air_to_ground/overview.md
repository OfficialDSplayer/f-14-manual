# Air to Ground

Despite being primarily designed as an air superioty fighter and an interceptor the F-14 was from the very start cleared and tested to carry all of the modern American general purpose bombs (GP) of the Mk-80 series. In addition it was also cleared to carry the Mk-20 Rockeye cluster bomb and the 5” Zuni folding-fin aircraft rocket (FFAR).

As the F-14’s combat role changed to include the precision ground attack mission it was also cleared to carry several of the guided bomb unit (GBU) versions of the Mk-80 series bombs, more specifically, some of the laser guided versions.
