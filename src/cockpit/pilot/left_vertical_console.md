| 3 | HORIZ TAIL | Horizontal stabilizer position indicators, shows position of left and right stabilizer surfaces, marked L or R respectively. |

## Launch Bar Abort Panel

![Launch Abort](../../img/launch-abort.png)

LAUNCH BAR – Selection switch – When held in ABORT lifts the launch bar for launch abortion. Spring-loaded to NORM (Normal) which is the standard position. Not currently used in DCS.

## Landing Gear Control Panel

![Gear Control](../../img/gear.png)

Control panel for the main landing gear and emergency stores jettison.

| No. | Control/Indicator  | Function                                                                                         |
|----|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | LDG GEAR           | Landing gear handle. Selects gear UP or DOWN.<br>For emergency extension in DOWN position, push handle in, turn clockwise and pull out. This releases a compressed nitrogen charge for emergency extension. |
| 2 | DOWN LOCK ORIDE    | Indicates weight on wheels when moved down by solenoid. Can be lifted up to override. Non-functional in DCS. |
| 3 | HYD ISOL           | Switch isolating landing gear, nosewheel steering and wheel brakes from the combined hydraulic system. Automatically moved to T.O./LDG by LDG GEAR in DOWN position.<br>FLT - In flight operation, isolates systems listed above.<br>T.O./LDG - Take-off/landing, connects systems listed above, allowing them to operate. |
| 4 | Transition light   | Illuminates to indicate landing gear position not corresponding to current LDG GEAR handle position. |
