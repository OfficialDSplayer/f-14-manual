### Radar Altimeter

![radaraltimeter](../../img/radaraltimeter.png)
Control and indicator for the radar altimeter.

| No. | Control/Indicator          | Function                                                                                       |
|-----|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Radar altimeter control knob | Fully counterclockwise position turns the altimeter off. Rotation clockwise sets the altitude warning level, increasing clockwise. Depressing the knob starts the altimeter BIT. |
| 2   | OFF flag                   | Shown if the system is off, power is off, or the system loses ground lock.                     |
| 3   | Low altitude warning light | Red light illuminated when below set altitude warning level.                                   |
| 4   | Self-test light            | Green light that should illuminate when the altimeter BIT is run. The readout should also display 100 feet +/- 10. |
| 5   | Low-altitude limit index   | Small triangular bug moving along the outer edge, displays set altitude warning level.         |

**Note:** Radio override does not disable the low-altitude warning tone.

### Servopneumatic Altimeter

![altimeter](../../img/altimeter.png)
Control and indicator for the servopneumatic altimeter.

| No. | Control/Indicator        | Function                                                                                      |
|-----|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Altimeter readout        | Displays altitude digitally on three drums showing 10,000, 1,000, and 100 feet respectively. It also displays altitude on a pointer on a circular scale indicating 100’s of feet. |
| 2   | Baroset knob             | Sets local pressure in inches of mercury (in.Hg). Only used locally on the altimeter readout, all other digital indicators (via CADC) use a set 29.92 in.Hg value. |
| 3   | Local barometric pressure| Indicates barometric pressure setting, also called the Kollsman Window.                      |
| 4   | Mode switch              | Three-position switch, spring-loaded to return from RESET. If power and altitude data from CADC is present, switch can be held in RESET for 3 seconds to allow normal (servoed) mode of operation. If set to STBY or power or CADC data is absent for more than 3 seconds, the system switches to backup (pressure) mode. |
| 5   | STBY flag                | Red flag reading STBY that appears if the system is in backup (stand-by) mode.               |

**Note:** At high speeds and below 10,000 feet, due to pressure changes, errors in readout up to as much as 1,200 feet when transonic and up to as much as 4,000 feet when supersonic can occur.

### Airspeed Mach Indicator

![mach](../../img/mach.png)
Indicated airspeed and Mach number display.

| No. | Control/Indicator               | Function                                                                                     |
|-----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Airspeed dial                   | Shows indicated airspeed on three scales, two for indicated airspeed and one moving for Mach number. |
| 2   | Indicated airspeed scale (outer)| Readout for indicated airspeed up to 200 knots.                                              |
| 3   | Indicated airspeed scale (inner)| Readout for indicated airspeed from 200 knots to 850 knots. Covered by airspeed dial until relevant. |
| 4   | Mach number scale               | Readout for Mach number. Moved to show correct Mach number relative to indicated airspeed.   |
| 5   | Indicated airspeed index pointer| Can be set to desired indicated airspeed.                                                    |
| 6   | Mach number index pointer       | Can be set to desired Mach number. Not visible in image.                                     |
| 7   | Safe Mach number index pointer  | Shows safe Mach number calculated by the CADC. Not visible in image.                         |
| 8   | Index knob                      | Knob with a pull-out and push-in position. One sets the indexer for indicated airspeed and the other for Mach number. |

### Vertical Velocity Indicator

![vvi](../../img/vvi.png)
Shows vertical velocity in thousands of feet. Can show erroneous readings if sudden or abrupt changes of attitude occur because of the changing airflow over the static probe.

### Left Engine Fuel Shutoff Handle

![leftengineshutoff](../../img/leftengineshutoff.png)
Pull to shut off fuel to the left engine in case of emergency. Push in to re-enable fuel flow to the engine. Should not be used to secure the engine.

Left engine fire extinguishing button is located behind the handle, accessible when the handle is pulled out.

### Angle-of-Attack Indicator

![aoa](../../img/aoa.png)
Tape indicating angle of attack (AOA) on a scale of 0 to 30 units. (Equivalent to -10° to +40° rotation of the AoA probe.)

The indicator has markers on the right for climb (5), cruise (8.5), and stall (29), and a reference bar for on-speed approach (15).
