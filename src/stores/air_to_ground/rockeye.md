# Mk-20 Rockeye
The Mk-20 Rockeye is a conventional free-fall bomb like the Mk-80 series bombs, but instead of a conventional charge, it carries anti-tank submunitions. The Rockeye contains 247 of these anti-tank submunitions, which are released at a set height using a radar altimeter, the design being that the submunitions are dispersed over a large area for greater effect.

The fuze height itself is set by the ground crew as they’re loaded and can’t be changed by the pilot. To arm the Rockeye correctly, the mechanical fuse should be set to nose (N).

The F-14 can carry up to 10 Mk-20 Rockeyes using the Phoenix rails and substations as well as TERs on the glove pylons.

**Note:** Additional fuse settings (FMU-140 fuse) pending additional weapon code implementation.
