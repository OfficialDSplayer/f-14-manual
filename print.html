<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>we are proud to present to you the <strong>Heatblur Simulations F-4E Phantom II</strong> for
Digital Combat Simulator. We’ve spent years of development and countless hours
of research to bring you the most in-depth recreation of this legendary aircraft
ever made. You will be able to fly your Phantom both as a pilot and WSO, alone
with the <strong>JESTER-AI</strong> - your own WSO AI - or in multiplayer together with a friend.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/phantom_flying_back.jpg" alt="Phantom from back" /></p>
<p>But not only did we recreate the Phantom’s flight model, systems, avionics,
radar, RWR and weapons delivery faithfully, we also tried to innovate our
approach to flight simulation in general with the module, laying important
groundwork for our future modules and as always trying to push the boundaries of
flight simulation just a little bit further. From small <strong>quality of life
improvements</strong> like being able to write on your canopy, to an <strong>interactive crew
chief</strong>, our Phantom also utilizes our next-gen components based simulation framework - the
aircraft is simulated as a connection of <strong>thousands of individual components</strong>.
From an instrument needle to control surfaces, each component influences the
state of the aircraft and even comes with its own <strong>wear and tear</strong>. From simulating
accurate power draw from the power source to the smallest light bulb and all the
nodes along the way, from hydraulic fluid which moves the hydraulics which in
turn move the flight surfaces all the way to a mass physics based model - things
now happen naturally, influenced by each other, and not <em>scripted</em> anymore.
Whether that means that unstable power draw may cause a lamp to flicker, or that
you can deploy your landing gear in case of a failure using gravity, or that
correct and incorrect use of the aircraft influences the wear and tear of each
single component individually - we never before attempted a simulation as deep
as with the F-4E Phantom II. The DCS: F-4 represents some of the most immersive
<strong>cold war fighter jet simulation</strong> available!</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/simulation_depth_wide.jpg" alt="Pilot Cockpit Details" /></p>
<p>Such innovation and in depth simulation will present an increased
learning curve for users. This is why it was important for us to also
innovate on the side of learning tools available to you, starting with this
manual, so that our modules are accessible to the casual simmer and aficionado
alike. You can <strong>open the manual in flight</strong>, and read along, but better still, you
can click any switch (with an input combo) in flight and the manual will open in
the correct chapter, <strong>explaining the switch</strong> or system in the cockpit, all while
you are bolting through the air in your thunderous jet. We also changed the
underlying structure of the manual to move to an <strong>open source</strong> model. This will allow the
community to easily contribute via GitHub, as two heads (or thousands of them) think
better than one. As an added benefit, readability for the mobile version will be greatly improved as
well. We have hyperlinked many items for you, providing easy <strong>navigation</strong> between cockpit diagrams
and system overviews. Also featured in the manual are numerous checklists and procedures, and a
<strong>"Lessons" section</strong>, which is planned to be featured with the Early Access Release of the Phantom.
The fully written out lessons will complement the flyable training missions. The training missions
are now tailored to be learned together with the written lesson in the manual, you will
be able to revert steps in the training mission, able to read along and pause
(no more restarting for missed items). With all of these features at your disposal, you will be able
to adequately prepare yourself for your training. And best of all, during your training you will be
instructed by real life F-4 pilots and a real life F-4 WSO Instructor! Who else could teach you
better?</p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy both learning and flying the F-4E Phantom II - dive as
deep as your heart desires. For this exciting journey we wish you <strong>good luck and
many fun adventures</strong>, and of course: always check six!</p>
<p>In the name of the entire Heatblur Team,<br />

<h2 id="f-14-tomcat"><a class="header" href="#f-14-tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a></h2>
<p><img src="intro/../img/F-14TU95.png" alt="F-14 Tomcat" />
<em>U.S. Navy photo by LT J.G. Thomas Prochilo. (DN-SC-83-06680)</em></p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat can trace its origin back to the 1950’s and the US Navy’s need for a carrier based long range interceptor to fill the Fleet Air Defence role. It was decided that it needed an aircraft with a more advanced and longer ranged radar as well as longer ranged air-to-air missile than the F-4 Phantom.</p>
<p>The Navy was directed, by then defense secretary Robert McNamara, to join the Tactical Fighter Experimental or TFX program to procure this aircraft in a joint venture with the US Air Force. The Navy was opposed to this from the beginning and the proposed General Dynamics F-111B did not meet the Navy’s expectations.</p>
<p>Grumman, which had been brought on board by General Dynamics for the Navy F-111B, was eventually awarded a contract to begin development of an aircraft more suited to the Navy’s requirements. This led to the design that would eventually become the F-14, carrying over the radar (AN/AWG-9) and missiles (AIM-54 Phoenix) from the failed F-111B project.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat first flew on the 21st of December 1970 and entered service on the 22nd of September 1974. The name “Tomcat” follows Grumman’s tradition of naming their aircraft after cats and also partially from the nickname “Tom’s Cat” for Vice Admiral Thomas F. Connolly who was instrumental for the development of the F-14.</p>
<h3 id="service-life-upgrades"><a class="header" href="#service-life-upgrades">Service Life Upgrades</a></h3>
<p>The first version of the F-14, the F-14A was equipped with the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 and carried an IRST system in the chinpod under the nose.</p>
<p>The TF30 engines were generally regarded as temperamental and underpowered for the F-14A and were eventually replaced by the General Electric F110-400 engines in the F-14A+ (later F-14B).</p>
<p>The IRST system was rather quickly determined to be underperforming and replaced with the TCS (Television Camera Set) in the chinpod allowing for greater than visual range identification of radar tracked targets.</p>
<p>Both the F-14A and F-14B received continuous upgrades during their life, including new programmable cockpit displays (PTID and PMDIG) as well as a new INS system, a digital flight control system (DFCS) and an RWR system amongst others.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Tactical Reconnaissance mission was also added to the F-14’s portfolio, enabled by the TARPS system, allowing the Tomcat to gather photographic reconnaissance material.</p>
<h3 id="ground-attack"><a class="header" href="#ground-attack">Ground Attack</a></h3>
<p><img src="intro/../img/bombcat.png" alt="Bombcat" />
<em>Photo by LCDR Dave Parsons. (DN-SC-93-01299)</em></p>
<p>During the 1990’s when the aerial threat to the fleets of the US Navy lessened and with the advent of operations like Desert Storm, the ground attack role was resurrected.</p>
<p>The ability to carry and deliver air-to-ground munitions had been implemented in the F-14 from the beginning but ruled out by the Navy as cost and risk ineffective given the F-14’s role as a Fleet Air Defence fighter.</p>
<p>With the renewed interest for this role, some of the F-14As and F-14Bs were equipped to carry the LANTIRN targeting pod allowing the RIO to find and designate laser guided bombs for his own aircraft and others. Later on the ability to carry and deliver gps-guided JDAMs was also added.</p>
<p>Most of the LANTIRN equipped aircraft were the ones upgraded with the programmable TID or (PTID) allowing for greater integration of the LANTIRN.</p>
<h3 id="f-14d"><a class="header" href="#f-14d">F-14D</a></h3>
<p>In the 1990’s the ultimate F-14 version was beginning to see service, the F-14D.</p>
<p>The F-14D used the same engines as the F-14B, the GE F110-400s in addition to using the digital flight control system, which was eventually retrofitted into operational F-14As and F-14Bs as well.</p>
<p>In addition, the F-14D also had a newer, more advanced version of the AN/AWG-9, the AN/APG-71, as well as a whole suite of upgraded avionics along with a new chinpod combining the TCS with a new, improved IRST system.</p>
<h3 id="end-of-service"><a class="header" href="#end-of-service">End of Service</a></h3>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat did eventually show its age, forcing the Navy to retire it due to increased maintenance costs and the general status of the now dated airframes. Additionally, the Tomcat’s primary role, the Fleet Air Defence role, seemingly disappeared with the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The Tomcat was finally retired in a ceremony on the 22nd of September 2006 at NAS Oceana.</p>

<p>The only other operator of the F-14 Tomcat was the Imperial Iranian Air Force, later the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, for which the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi acquired 80 Tomcats.</p>
<p>The eventual fall of the Shah and the rise of the Islamic Republic of Iran meant that a country now opposed to the United States had access to one of its most advanced fighter aircraft. This meant that the Iranian F-14s now lost access to new spare parts and missiles, apart from black market sources, greatly increasing the difficulty of maintaining the aircraft.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat was used during the Iran-Iraq war, claiming a great number of air-to-air victories over the Iraqi Air Force, with some sources going so far as to claim that Iraqi pilots at times left the contested air space to avoid facing the AN/AWG-9 - AIM-54 combo.</p>
<p>To this date the IRIAF continues to fly the F-14 Tomcat as the sole operator. It’s not entirely known how the Iranians source their spare parts but it’s assumed that they’ve had to cannibalize inoperable aircraft to keep a portion of their fleet flying. In addition, rumours exist mentioning black market sources as well as indigenous production of some parts.</p>
<p>The Iranian operated Tomcats are of the earlier F-14A revisions, using the TF30 engines and lacking a TCS or IRST system.</p>
<h2 id="aim-54-phoenix"><a class="header" href="#aim-54-phoenix">AIM-54 Phoenix</a></h2>
<p><img src="intro/../img/phoenix.jpg" alt="Phoenix Missile" />
<em>U.S. Navy photo by Capt. Dana Potts. (020924-N-1955P-001)</em></p>
<p>The AIM-54 long-range air-to-air missile was born from the same TFX program as that which eventually led to the F-14 Tomcat.</p>
<p>It was designed for the F-111B and then adopted for the F-14 as a long-range missile capable of long range engagement of enemy bombers in addition to hostile cruise missiles. That’s not to say that the AIM-54 Phoenix was a slouch at engaging other smaller targets as well.</p>
<p>Outstanding features of the AIM-54 missiles were their long range as well as their ability to be launched at up to six simultaneous targets, guided first by the AN/AWG-9 radar in the launching aircraft and then its own active radar seeker independently.</p>
<p>The original AIM-54 Phoenix was the AIM-54A with a mk47 rocket motor. The motor was later on upgraded, creating the mk60 motor, increasing the missile’s range. Eventually the AIM-54 itself was also upgraded, resulting in the AIM-54C with, amongst other things, an upgraded seeker head and a newer version of the mk47 producing less smoke, making the missile hard to spot visually.</p>
<p>The US Navy fired only three AIM-54 missiles in combat, all three over Iraq. The missiles never hit their intended targets though as two of the missiles’ rocket motors failed with the third also missing its target as it turned tail and ran.</p>
<p>While little is known for certain in the western hemisphere, the IRIAF claims at least 78 air-to-air victories using the AIM-54 against Iraqi MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-25s, Mirage F-1s, Super Etendards and even some anti-ship cruise missiles.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="f-4e-air-to-air-kills"><a class="header" href="#f-4e-air-to-air-kills">F-4E Air to Air Kills</a></h1>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II, an upgraded version of the F-4 Phantom series, played a
significant role in air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War. Equipped with the
AIM-7 Sparrow missile, a radar-guided weapon with beyond-visual-range
capabilities, the F-4E had a notable advantage in engagements.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, F-4E pilots engaged in dogfights against various enemy aircraft. The
Sparrow missile allowed them to target adversaries from a distance, contributing
to the aircraft's success. Key USAF pilots, such as Steve Ritchie and Chuck
DeBellevue, achieved ace status by securing five or more air-to-air victories.</p>
<p>The total number of air-to-air kills attributed to the F-4E Phantom II,
combining both the USAF and USN, is estimated to be around 21 during the Vietnam
War, including 4 MiG-19s and 17 MiG-21s. However, this figure may vary across
sources. In total, F-4C/D/E Variants shot down 107 MiG jets, rewarding it the
nickname <em>"Biggest distributor of MiG parts"</em>.</p>
<p>Despite its effectiveness, the F-4E faced challenges in close-quarters combat
due to the initial absence of an internal cannon. Modifications, including the
addition of an M61 Vulcan cannon, addressed this limitation and improved the
aircraft's performance in close-range engagements.</p>
<p>The success of the F-4E Phantom II in Vietnam solidified its reputation as a
versatile and formidable fighter, and it continued to serve in air forces
worldwide for many years.</p>

<p>The Central Air Data Computer or CADC is the computer acting as the spider in the web for most aircraft flight sensors and relaying this information to all systems needing them. In addition, it also controls the wing-sweep via the wing-sweep schedule and also controls the flaps and slats as they are limited by that same schedule.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="flight-control-system-1"><a class="header" href="#flight-control-system-1">Flight Control System</a></h1>
<p>The flight control system on the F-14 Tomcat is driven by the two main hydraulic circuits, powered by pumps connected to each engine.</p>
<p>For longitudinal (pitch) control both tail stabilizers are deflected in unison, acting in the same way as traditional elevators.</p>
<p>Lateral (roll) control is produced by both the tail stabilizers and the spoilers working in unison. To produce roll the stabilizers are deflected opposite each other to act as ailerons in combination with the spoilers on the side to which roll is commanded.</p>
<p>The rudders on the F-14 is a standard rudder configuration albeit in a two tail, two rudder configuration.</p>
<p>Control surface position is indicated on the Control Surface Position Indicator and can also be used to check trim position with controls at neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Above 15 units AOA, the rudders should be used for lateral (roll) control due to the different airflow along the aircraft control surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="trim"><a class="header" href="#trim">Trim</a></h2>
<p>Longitudinal and lateral trim is accomplished via the trim hat on the Control Stick. This changes the stick neutral position, thus trimming the aircraft. Rudder trim is accomplished via the RUDDER TRIM switch on the Inlet Ramps/Throttle Control Panel, changing the neutral rudder position.</p>
<p>The Mach Trim and ITS (Integrated Trim System) automatically trims to compensate for changes in longitudinal trim. The Mach Trim system compensates for transonic and supersonic trim changes and the ITS for trim changes due to flap and speedbrake position changes.</p>
<h2 id="afcs-automatic-flight-control-system"><a class="header" href="#afcs-automatic-flight-control-system">AFCS Automatic Flight Control System</a></h2>
<p>The AFCS or Automatic Flight Control System provides additional aircraft stability (SAS or Stability Augmentation System) via automatic control surface commands generated from AFCS sensors. The AFCS is controlled by switches on the AFCS Control Panel, and pitch, roll, and yaw can each be set individually.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitch and roll switches:</strong> Spring-loaded to off but normally held to on by solenoids, meaning that if the system is turned off or inoperable, the switches return to off. The yaw switch is purely mechanical.</li>
<li><strong>Roll SAS:</strong> Should not be used for situations involving flight at AOA above 15 units and should therefore be set to off for combat maneuvers.</li>
<li><strong>Autopilot emergency disengage paddle:</strong> On the control stick, if held down, sets the pitch and roll channels to off.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="autopilot"><a class="header" href="#autopilot">Autopilot</a></h2>
<p>Apart from stability augmentation, the AFCS is also used to provide autopilot functionality. To use the autopilot, all three stabilization channels must be enabled.</p>
<h3 id="autopilot-modes"><a class="header" href="#autopilot-modes">Autopilot Modes</a></h3>
<p>The controls for the autopilot system are situated on the AFCS Control Panel. Available modes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attitude hold:</strong> Set the autopilot ENGAGE switch to on to maintain current aircraft attitude. Limited to within 30° pitch and 60° roll angles. The current attitude can be changed with the control stick and will be held when the stick is released.</li>
<li><strong>Heading hold:</strong> Set the HDG switch to HDG. Maneuver the aircraft to the desired heading with a bank angle of less than 5° to set the heading.</li>
<li><strong>Ground track mode:</strong> Set the HDG switch to GT, wait for the A/P REF warning light on the left side of the Vertical Display Indicator (VDI) to illuminate, and then press the nosewheel steering button on the control stick. The A/P REF warning light will turn off, and the ground track mode will be enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Altitude hold mode:</strong> Set via the ALT switch. The A/P REF warning light will illuminate until the nosewheel steering button is depressed, enabling the mode.</li>
<li><strong>Data Link Vector - Precision Course Direction mode:</strong> Allows a Link 4 controller to remotely control the aircraft. (Not modeled in DCS)</li>
<li><strong>ACL or Automatic Carrier Landing mode:</strong> Used for automatic carrier landings in conjunction with the Link 4 data link and the onboard radar beacon. Set the VEC/PCD switch to ACL, and the A/P REF warning light will illuminate. When intercepting the ACL glideslope and with the ACL READY and A/P CPLR warning lights illuminated on the VDI, depress the nosewheel steering button on the control stick to engage the ACL.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ACL can be used in conjunction with the APC (see Throttle Controls) for a fully automatic landing. The ACL can be disengaged via the PLM button on the right throttle and the APC via the CAGE/SEAM button on the left throttle.</p>
<p>All autopilot modes can be overridden by enough force on the control stick or by depression of the autopilot emergency disengagement paddle, automatically resetting all autopilot switches to off.</p>
<h2 id="spoilers"><a class="header" href="#spoilers">Spoilers</a></h2>
<p>The spoilers located on the upper surfaces of the wings are used to control roll as detailed above under Flight Control System, for braking on the ground as part of the Antiskid system and as a part of the DLC system (see next header).</p>
<p>The spoilers are only used forwards of 62° wing-sweep as further aft these conflict with the fuselage.</p>
<p>In case of a spoiler malfunction the spoiler symmetry protection logic disables all of the spoilers in the same section as the failed spoiler, either inboard or outboard spoilers. If this occurs the SPOILERS caution light on the Caution - Advisory Indicator illuminates.</p>
<p>To override this the switch corresponding to the relevant section on the Spoiler Failure Override can be set to override by lifting the guard and setting the switch to ORIDE and then depressing the MASTER RESET button on the Fuel Management Panel.</p>
<p>Spoiler position can be seen on the Control Surface Position Indicator.</p>
<h2 id="dlc-direct-lift-control"><a class="header" href="#dlc-direct-lift-control">DLC Direct Lift Control</a></h2>
<p>The DLC or Direct Lift Control is used to control vertical glideslope position without pitch control inputs or engine throttle commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Engage the DLC by depressing the DLC switch on the control stick with flaps down and throttles less than MIL. This causes the inboard spoilers to extend to half and enables the DLC &amp; maneuver flap command thumbwheel on the control stick to control them.</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Rotation of the thumbwheel forwards extends the spoilers, decreasing lift and adjusting glideslope position downward. Rotation of the thumbwheel aft retracts the spoilers, increasing lift and adjusting glideslope position upward.</li>
<li><strong>Disengagement:</strong> Another depression of the DLC switch disengages the system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flaps-and-slats"><a class="header" href="#flaps-and-slats">Flaps and Slats</a></h2>
<p>The flaps and slats on the F-14 Tomcat can be used in two modes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal flap and slat extension:</strong> Controlled using the FLAP handle on the Throttle Quadrant. The flaps can be set to anywhere between retracted and fully extended where the flaps will extend to 35° and the slats to 17°. The auxiliary flaps, the innermost section, only have two positions, retracted and extended. They will extend fully when the FLAP handle is at more than 5° extension.
<ul>
<li><strong>Faulty retraction:</strong> If a fault prevents retraction, move the FLAP handle to the UP position and then outboard and up to the EMER UP position to override faulty interlocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maneuver flap system:</strong> The CADC uses the flaps and slats automatically to improve aircraft performance. In this mode, the flaps extend to 10° maximum and the slats to 7° maximum, and the innermost flap section is disabled.
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual control:</strong> The maneuver flap system can be manually controlled using the DLC &amp; maneuver flap command thumbwheel on the control stick. Forward thumbwheel rotation retracts the flaps and slats, and aft thumbwheel rotation extends them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When sweeping the wings, the flaps are limited by the wing-sweep position. Aft of 21° sweep, the auxiliary (inboard flaps) are disabled up. Aft of 50°, all flaps are disabled up. The slats are not inhibited by wing-sweep.</p>
<p>Position of the flaps and slats are indicated on the Wheels-Flaps Position Indicator.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FLAP light:</strong> The FLAP light on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator indicates a malfunction in the flap system with flaps at non-symmetrical positions.</li>
<li><strong>REDUCE SPEED warning light:</strong> The REDUCE SPEED warning light on the left side of the Vertical Display Indicator (VDI) indicates flaps not retracted above 225 knots indicated airspeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speedbrakes"><a class="header" href="#speedbrakes">Speedbrakes</a></h2>
<p>The speedbrakes on the F-14 Tomcat consist of three sections on the tail located between the engines and are powered by the combined hydraulic system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> The speedbrake controls are located on the right Throttle and can be set to the desired position depending on how long the switch is held to the extend position. Retraction always fully retracts the speedbrakes.</li>
<li><strong>Protection:</strong> The speedbrakes will start retracting above 400 knots and will continue to do so with increasing airspeed. Additionally, selection of MIL power or above automatically retracts them.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel dump:</strong> As the speedbrakes disturb airflow around the tail, the fuel dump is disabled with speedbrake extension to prevent the fuel from hitting the aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p>Position of the speedbrakes can be seen on the Wheels-Flaps Position Indicator.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="wing-sweep-system"><a class="header" href="#wing-sweep-system">Wing-Sweep System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/sweepschedule.png" alt="sweepschedule" /></p>
<p>Wing-sweep schedule as function of Mach number and related flap interlocks.</p>
<p>The wing-sweep system controls the geometry of the F-14’s wings, allowing the wings to move from a 20° to a 68° position in the air. While on the deck an oversweep of 75° is also possible reducing the F-14’s wing span to 33 feet (about 10 meters).</p>
<p>The wings are moved by hydromechanical screwjack actuators which are interconnected mechanically, making sure they’re synchronized. As long as both main hydraulic systems are functioning the maximum wing-sweep change rate is about 15°/s. This can be affected negatively by negative g or large amounts of positive g.</p>
<p>In normal operation the CADC, Central Air Data Computer, controls the wing position as a function of current Mach via the wing-sweep program, this is known as the AUTO mode. The pilot can also select a wing position aft of the wing-sweep program manually or choose the BOMB mode that sets the wings to 55° or further aft depending on the program. Simply put, the CADC wing-sweep program determines the max forward position of the wings. All this is done electrically via two independent channels (for redundancy) to the wing-sweep actuators.</p>
<p>Currently commanded wing position, CADC program wing position and actual wing position can be seen on the wing-sweep indicator next to the ACM panel.</p>
<h3 id="emergency-mode"><a class="header" href="#emergency-mode">Emergency Mode</a></h3>
<p>While the normal mode controls the wing-sweep electrically, to supplement this it’s also possible to control the wing-sweep mechanically via the emergency mode. This is done via the emergency wing-sweep handle on the right side of the throttle. That handle is connected mechanically to the hydraulic valves in the wing-sweep system, providing a physical back-up control.</p>
<p>Normally this handle is moved with the electronic wing-sweep program by a servo located beneath it, making sure it’s at the actual wing position. To disengage the electric system and enable the emergency mode the guard over the handle is opened and then the handle is extended for additional leverage. Then the handle can be forced out of the spider-detent normally connecting it to the electrical servo and then used to manually set the wing position.</p>
<p>In this mode the pilot has to make sure to follow the following schedule to avoid damage to the wings:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Speed (Indicated Mach)</th><th>Max Forward Wing Position</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>0.4</td><td>20°</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.7</td><td>25°</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.8</td><td>50°</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.9</td><td>60°</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.0</td><td>68°</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>To return to the normal mode of operation, the handle should be pushed into the desired position and pressed down and the guard closed. The MASTER RESET button on the fuel management panel should then be depressed and the wing-sweep system set to the same position as the handle. The servo will then drive to the commanded position and re-engage the handle to the spider detent, resuming normal operation.</p>
<h3 id="oversweep"><a class="header" href="#oversweep">Oversweep</a></h3>
<p>The emergency wing-sweep handle is also used to select the oversweep position of the wings. The oversweep is only used while on the ground to reduce the wing span to make it easier to spot the aircraft on the carrier deck. As the wing will sweep over the stabilizers on the tail the horizontal tail authority system is enabled to prevent the wings and stabilizers from damaging each other by restricting movement of the stabilizer.</p>
<p>To set the wings to oversweep the emergency wing-sweep handle should be moved to the 68° position and held in the extended position. This will deflate the wing-seal airbags and activate the horizontal tail authority system, indicated by the HZ TAIL AUTH caution light illuminating. When the HZ TAIL AUTH caution light goes out and the OVER flag on the wing-sweep indicator appears the oversweep interlocks are free and the handle can now be moved to the 75° position and stowed.</p>
<p>To move the wings out of oversweep the handle is pulled up and moved forwards of 68°. This will again illuminate the HZ TAIL AUTH caution light. When the wings have physically exited the oversweep the caution light and the OVER flag will turn off.</p>
<p>As with normal emergency mode operation the handle should now be set to the same position as the spider detent and the MASTER RESET button depressed.</p>
<h3 id="controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-indicators">Controls and Indicators</a></h3>
<p>The controls for the wing-sweep system are on the right throttle (electrical) and to the right of the right throttle (mechanical). See the Throttle and the Throttle Quadrant.</p>
<p>The wing-sweep hat on the right throttle is normally set to AUTO enabling CADC control of the wings, this is the upper position. The down position sets the wing-sweep to the BOMB mode, 55° or aft.</p>
<p>The AFT and FWD (forward) positions enable manual movement aft of the CADC scheduled position.</p>
<p>The emergency wing-sweep handle on the throttle quadrant is used to control the mechanical emergency mode, see emergency mode above.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/wingsweep1.png" alt="wingsweep" /></p>
<p>The wing-sweep indicator to the right of the ACM panel is used to indicate the current wing-sweep positions. The pointer on the left side shows the CADC scheduled wing position. The left tape shows the manually commanded position and the right tape shows the actual wing position.</p>
<p>The five windows on the right side show:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OFF:</strong> System inoperable.</li>
<li><strong>AUTO:</strong> CADC controlling wing-sweep.</li>
<li><strong>MAN:</strong> Wings set manually with the control on the right throttle.</li>
<li><strong>EMER:</strong> Wings set with the emergency wing-sweep handle.</li>
<li><strong>OVER:</strong> Wings in oversweep.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant warning and advisory lights are located on the Vertical Display Indicator (VDI) and the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator.</p>
<p>The WING SWEEP advisory light on the right side of the VDI illuminates when both wing-sweep electrical channels are inoperable or the emergency mode is in use. If it illuminates without the emergency mode being used that mode should then be used as the electrical system might not work.</p>
<p>The WING SWEEP caution light on the pilot caution - advisory indicator illuminates when at least one electrical wing-sweep channel is inoperable.</p>
<h3 id="wing-sweep-system-test"><a class="header" href="#wing-sweep-system-test">Wing-Sweep System Test</a></h3>
<p>The wing-sweep system can be tested on the ground in pre-flight without moving the wings using the Master Test Panel.</p>
<p>To conduct the test, set the wing-sweep mode to AUTO and push the MASTER RESET button. Set the MASTER TEST switch to WG SWP.</p>
<p>The CADC commanded position indicator on the wing-sweep indicator will now move to 44°. The WING SWEEP and FLAP light will illuminate on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator and the REDUCE SPEED warning light on the Vertical Display Indicator (VDI).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The WING SWEEP advisory light will illuminate after 3 seconds into test, turn off and then illuminate again at 8 seconds.</p>
<p>When the CADC commanded position indicator moves forward to the 20° position the test is over and the above light will turn off. The MASTER TEST switch can now be set to OFF and the test is complete. The test will take about 25 seconds to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The RUDDER AUTH and/or MACH TRIM lights might illuminate and the control stick might move. This can be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> The WG SWP test on the Master Test panel is not implemented yet.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="landing-gear-system"><a class="header" href="#landing-gear-system">Landing Gear System</a></h1>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat has a tricycle landing gear designed to be fully retractable and hardened enough to withstand the rigors of carrier traps. The landing gear extension and retraction is powered by the combined hydraulic system and has an emergency extension system. The emergency extension system has a nitrogen bottle that can be used for a one-shot emergency extension. With the emergency system triggered, it needs to be reset by technicians on the ground to allow further normal retraction.</p>
<p>For additional information on controls and indicators, see the Landing Gear Control Panel for controls and the Wheels-Flaps Position Indicator for the indicators.</p>
<h2 id="nosewheel-steering"><a class="header" href="#nosewheel-steering">Nosewheel Steering</a></h2>
<p>The nosewheel steering system on the F-14 can be activated with weight on wheels by depression of the nosewheel steering button on the Control Stick. The activation of this system is indicated via the NWS ENGA caution light on the left side of the HUD, see Wheels Warning/Brakes Warnings/ACLS/AP Caution/NWS Engage Caution/Auto Throttle Caution Lights.</p>
<p>Disengagement of this system occurs automatically with weight off wheels (take-off), electrical supply failure, or lowering of the launch bar. It’s also possible to deactivate the system by depression of the nosewheel steering button.</p>
<p>The nosewheel, with the system engaged, is controlled via the rudder pedals. It’s capable of a deflection of up to 70°, meaning that it will turn tightly enough that the inner wheel will move backward.</p>
<h2 id="wheelbrakes"><a class="header" href="#wheelbrakes">Wheelbrakes</a></h2>
<p>The wheelbrakes can be applied either via the rudder pedals by pressing on the upper part of them, rotating them forwards. The other application is via the parking brake handle located on the Landing Gear Control Panel panel.</p>
<p>The rudder pedals can be used to apply the brakes gradually while the parking brakes are either on or off.</p>
<p>Normally both systems are supplied from the combined hydraulic system but if that system becomes depressurised the brake system automatically switches to the backup accumulators. The Emergency Brake Pressure Indicator shows current pressure in the emergency accumulators.</p>
<p>If fully charged the auxiliary accumulator allows for about 13 to 14 wheelbrake applications from the pedals and the parking brake accumulator 3 parking brake applications minimum. These accumulators can be recharged via the Hydraulic Hand Pump.</p>
<p>The BRAKES warning light on the left side of the HUD indicates either parking brake applied, antiskid system fail or that the brakes are operating in the emergency mode (only when the pedals are depressed).</p>
<h2 id="antiskid"><a class="header" href="#antiskid">Antiskid</a></h2>
<p>The antiskid system modulates the wheelbrakes to prevent skidding while on the ground. When armed in the air the system prevents braking until both main wheels are on the ground and the wheels have spun up. Also the system is not operational below 15 knots.</p>
<p>The antiskid system switch also controls the spoiler brake system that deploys the spoilers as brakes when the throttles are set to IDLE while on the ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The antiskid should be disabled during taxi as below 15 knots, the system may disturb normal braking even though the antiskid feature is not operational at those speeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ANTI SKID SPOILER BK switch on the Fuel Management Panel panel controls the system. OFF disables the system, BOTH enables antiskid and the spoiler brake system and SPOILER BK enables only the spoiler brake system.</p>

<h3 id="nosegear-catapult-system"><a class="header" href="#nosegear-catapult-system">Nosegear Catapult System</a></h3>
<p>The nosegear of the F-14 contains the system allowing for catapult assisted takeoff during carrier based operations.</p>
<p>The three components mounted in or on the nosegear are the nosewheel kneel functionality, the launch bar and the holdback fitting.</p>
<p>To enable the system the aircraft is kneeled using the NOSE STRUT switch on the Landing Gear Control Panel. This is done by holding the switch to the KNEEL position until downward movement stops.</p>
<p>This drains hydraulic fluid from the shock absorber, compressing the nosegear strut 14 inches. When compressed this also releases the lock on the launch bar which can then be lowered manually by the deck crew or by turning the nosegear more than 10° from center.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In DCS, the launch bar is automatically lowered with nosegear kneel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aircraft can then be guided onto the catapult and connected to the shuttle, in DCS via default keybind U. The holdback bar is currently not modelled in DCS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Deselection of nosewheel steering should be done before final movement onto the shuttle and hookup to avoid misalignment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final command to launch the aircraft, after proper procedures, is then to salute the “shooter” or officer in command of catapult launch, default keybind Left Shift + U in DCS.</p>
<p>After the catapult stroke, when the launch bar is released from the shuttle, stored hydraulic energy is released to impart a positive pitch moment to the aircraft. This also automatically raises the launch bar into its stowed position.</p>
<p>Indication of the launch bar status is available on the Caution - Advisory Indicator via the LAUNCH BAR advisory light. The advisory light is on with weight on wheels when the launch bar is not up and locked and turns off if throttles are advanced to MIL to enable a lights out for launch criteria. With weight off wheels the LAUNCH BAR advisory light is on if the nose strut hasn’t fully extended, launch bar is not up and locked or nosewheel hasn’t centered correctly. This inhibits nosegear retraction.</p>
<p>The Launch Bar Abort Panel contains the LAUNCH BAR switch used to disengage the launch bar in case of an aborted launch. This functionality is currently not implemented in DCS, unhooking the launch bar is currently accomplished by another depression of the hookup key, default key U.</p>
<h3 id="arresting-gear"><a class="header" href="#arresting-gear">Arresting Gear</a></h3>
<p>The arresting hook located on the underside of the tail of the F-14 is used for arrested landings during carrier operations.</p>
<p>The system uses hydraulic power from both flight and combined hydraulic systems and is controlled electrically, thus requiring electrical power as well.</p>
<p>Operation of the system is via the arresting HOOK handle on the Arresting Hook Panel. UP raises the arresting hook and DN, down, lowers it to 37° allowing it to catch the wire during a correctly executed carrier “trap”. The transition light next to the arresting HOOK handle illuminates whenever the arresting hook position does not correspond with handle position.</p>
<p>If on board failures do not allow for normal hook lowering it’s possible to use a mechanical backup to deploy the hook. To activate the mechanical backup, pull the handle out and rotate it 90° counterclockwise. This releases the mechanical uplock and drain the hydraulic pressure keeping the hook up, thus lowering it.</p>
<p>If electrical power and hydraulic power are restored, it’s then possible to retract the hook by rotating the handle 90° clockwise and pushing the handle back in and then setting it in the default UP position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Hook position also affects the AoA indexer and approach lights, making them flash with gear down if the hook is not also down. This feature can be disabled using the HOOK BYPASS switch on the Master Light Control Panel.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="engines-and-throttle-controls"><a class="header" href="#engines-and-throttle-controls">Engines and Throttle Controls</a></h2>
<p>The F-14A is powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30-P-414A while the F-14B is powered by two General Electrics F110-GE-400, both of which are afterburning turbofan engines.</p>
<p>To provide the engines with an even subsonic airflow the F-14 has the AICS or Air Inlet Control System. This system controls the variable geometry intakes by moving the variable ramps mounted in them to slow the airflow. This is accomplished using various sensor inputs run through a calculation using set schedules which decides the positions of the ramps.</p>
<p>In addition, the TF30 uses two systems to improve reliable operation, the Mid Compression Bypass System (MCB) and the Mach Lever.</p>
<p>The MCB helps mitigate high angle of attack airflow onto the compressor fans to reduce the risk of an engine stall. This system vents air from the compressor section to bypass duct to stabilize the airflow for later compressor stages. Normally this system uses angle of attack and Mach number sensor data to activate, but with the landing gear handle in the down position this it is only activated with zone 5 afterburner. Additionally the WCS commands the MCB to activate with extension of the refuelling probe as well as when launching AIM-7 or AIM-9 missiles, air to ground rockets or firing the M61 Vulcan gun.</p>
<p>The Mach Lever also mitigates the risk of an engine stall by controlling min and max rpm allowed as a function of Mach number. In addition it also increases the minimum rpm in high angle of attack regimes while subsonic.</p>
<p>The two F110s in F-14B, on the other hand, are controlled by the AFTC (Augmenter Fan Temperature Control unit). The AFTC is an early engine control computer akin to an early version of a FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) used on newer turbine engines. This system controls both the engine itself as well as the variable exhaust nozzles controlling the engine exhaust gases and removes the need for the MCB and Mach Lever for the F110. The lack of such a system in the F-14A controlling its TF30s is one of the reasons for them being deemed less reliable than the F110s.</p>
<p>In case of a failure in the AFTC the MEC (Main engine control) is capable of assuming control of the engines to provide a fall-back, mechanical control. The normal mode, AFTC, is the primary mode (PRI) and called as such while the fall-back MEC is the secondary (SEC) mode. The selection of primary or secondary is automatic in case of a failure in the AFTC but can also be manually selected. Of note is that in secondary mode the engine nozzles are fully closed and disabled in addition to the afterburners being disabled with a corresponding loss of engine performance.</p>
<p>In addition both engines also drive separate fuel, hydraulic and electric generators to create redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The main difference between the TF30 and F110 engines (apart from lesser thrust in the TF30s) is that the TF30s are more sensitive to the quality of the airflow entering the compressor face. In general it is wise to avoid anything less than military power or afterburner while in high angle of attack maneuvers as well as avoiding large rudder inputs or asymmetric engine throttle settings. That said, the TF30s in the HB F-14A module have been extensively tuned using available data and SME expertise, resulting in an accurate modelling of an engine undeserving of its bad reputation. One “advantage” of the TF30’s mechanical fuel control is its high speed thrust, resulting in higher top speeds than the F110 can achieve. If flown within normal parameters, the TF30 engines behave well if a tad underpowered compared to the F110s.</p>
<h2 id="throttle-controls"><a class="header" href="#throttle-controls">Throttle Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/throttles-schem1.png" alt="throttles" /></p>
<p>The throttles in the F-14 have detents preventing unintentional engine start and shutdown and unintentional selection of afterburner. In addition the throttles also controls several different systems depending on throttle position as shown in the diagram above. The most critical of these being the fuel cutoff and ignition systems in the respective engines.</p>
<p>For throttle operations there are three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Mode:</strong> A mechanical mode in which the engines are controlled by mechanical linkages directly from the throttles to the engines. The manual mode is designed as a backup mode and may be inexact because of the mechanical nature of the controls.</li>
<li><strong>Boost Mode:</strong> The normal mode of operation in which electrical paths control actuators moving the same engine controls as the mechanical linkages but more exactly and with lesser force required.</li>
<li><strong>Approach Power Compensator Mode (Auto Throttle Mode):</strong> A system which allows for automatic throttle control for optimal angle-of-attack during approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>The controls for the throttle mode are located on the inlet ramps/throttle control panel to the side of the main throttles and allows for selection of all three modes. The auto throttle mode is solenoid held and will revert to boost mode if the criteria for automatic controls are not met.</p>
<p>To allow selection of auto mode the throttles need to be between 75 to 90% rpm, the gear handle needs to be down and with no weight on the wheels. If these criteria are no longer met, the throttles are manually overridden with force or the Cage/SEAM button on the left throttle is depressed the solenoid releases the switch and it reverts to boost.</p>
<p>For additional autothrottle tune the gain of the system can be set on the inlet ramps/throttle control panel. The settings are hot, normal or cold with hot increasing the throttle gain (and effective thrust) and cold decreasing it. These settings correspond to cold or hot external temperatures but should be set according to observed throttle control.</p>
<p>The RATS or reduced arrestment thrust system is a system limiting engine thrust after touchdown to limit it to levels appropriate for carrier environments. The system is enabled by weight on either main landing gear and is disabled by selection of afterburner on the throttles.</p>
<p>Finally, and implemented only for the F110-GE-400, is the asymmetric limiter, preventing asymmetric afterburner engagement if only one afterburner lights by keeping that afterburner at minimum afterburner thrust until the other afterburner also lights.</p>
<h2 id="engine-and-throttle-control-switches-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#engine-and-throttle-control-switches-and-indicators">Engine and Throttle Control Switches and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/inlet1.png" alt="inlet" /></p>
<p>The inlet ramps/throttle control panel contains most other engine related controls.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>THROTTLE MODE switch:</strong> Sets throttle mode to AUTO, BOOST or MAN modes respectively, with auto being spring-loaded back to boost but held in place electrically as mentioned above.</li>
<li><strong>THROTTLE TEMP switch:</strong> Controls the gain of the automatic throttle system also described above.</li>
<li><strong>INLET RAMPS switches:</strong> Enable (AUTO) or disable, stow (STOW) the variable intake ramps.</li>
<li><strong>Engine crank switch:</strong> Used to crank the engines to 20% rpm allowing for engine start by moving the respective throttle to idle from cut-off. The air to start the engine is sourced from an external air supply if connected or the other engine if no external source exists. At 50% rpm the crank switch automatically returns to off/center position. If this does not occur it should be manually set to off to prevent damage to the air turbine starter.</li>
<li><strong>BACK UP IGNITION switch:</strong> Enables the backup ignition system in case of a failure in the main ignition circuits that are normally enabled by moving the throttles out of the cut-off position.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/asym1.png" alt="asym" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> F-14B only.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ASYM LIMITER switch:</strong> On the ASYM limiter/engine mode select panel enables or disables the asymmetric afterburner thrust limiter. Default position is ON and the switch has a guard cover keeping it in that position.</li>
<li><strong>ENG (engine) MODE SELECT switches:</strong> Setting the left (L ENG) and right (R ENG) to PRI, primary or SEC, secondary modes respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/mcb1.png" alt="mcb" /></p>

<li><strong>BINGO indicator:</strong> Displays currently set BINGO fuel level, this quantity is set by rotating the knob (5) to desired amount. This indicator and control activates the BINGO caution light when total fuel level is below set amount.</li>
<li><strong>TOTAL indicator:</strong> Displays total carried fuel.</li>
<li><strong>L and R indicators:</strong> Normally shows fuel carried in left and right fuel feeds respectively. A rocker switch on the fuel management panel enables selection of the wing internal tanks (WING) or external fuel tanks (EXT) for display but is spring-loaded to return to showing the feed tanks (FEED) automatically. When displaying wing internal tanks or external fuel tanks, the left wing or left external tank is shown on the L counter and the right wing or right external tank on the R counter.</li>

<li><strong>QTY SEL rocker switch:</strong> Detailed above under the description above about the L &amp; R fuel displays.</li>
<li><strong>FEED switch:</strong> Allows the pilot to correct fuel imbalances caused by single engine operation or feed failures by selecting both engines to feed from either the FWD (forward and right tanks) or AFT (aft and left tanks) instead of from one feed system each as normal NORM. The switch guard locks the switch to the NORM position when down.</li>
<li><strong>WING/EXT TRANS switch:</strong> Controls fuel transfer from the wing and external tanks into the fuselage feed systems. The normal AUTO position enables this transfer as soon the landing gear is retracted. The ORIDE position enables this transfer regardless of landing gear position, enabling transfer when on the ground or during a malfunction in the electrical system inhibiting landing gear retraction detection. Additionally the OFF position disables this transfer but can be overridden automatically to AUTO when the INST test is performed on the MTS panel, the refuel probe is set to ALL EXTD or when dumping fuel.</li>
<li><strong>DUMP switch:</strong> Enables fuel dump through the beaver tail fuel dump mast, it also enables all fuel transfer systems, enabling dump of fuel in wings and external tanks in addition to the fuselage. If there’s weight on the wheels or the speed brake is not fully retracted the fuel dump is inhibited.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though technically possible to engage the afterburners after a fuel dump is in progress, this is not allowed due to the possibility of igniting the dumped fuel.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="navigation--communication"><a class="header" href="#navigation--communication">Navigation &amp; Communication</a></h1>
<p>The F-14’s primary navigation system is a multi-unit Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigation System (CAINS) designated as AN/ASN-92. An INS system measures and integrates sensed inertia forces (acceleration) and rotational velocities to calculate aircraft position and linear velocity. A good navigation system can precisely guide an aircraft on a route to a mission objective hundreds or thousands of miles long, and then back to the home base, safely and reliably. Such a system is even more important when an aircraft is designed to operate over the ocean, far away from any ground-based TACAN or visual references.</p>
<p>Designing an INS (IMU) is an engineering challenge, which requires consideration of such problems as calibration, alignment, Earth’s rotational motion, inertia forces, thermal stability, analogue-digital converters precision, all different types of corrections which have to be applied to keep the device precise over extended time, and many more. Simulating an INS platform is very similar - it is a complex undertaking.</p>
<p>At Heatblur, we decided to develop an entirely new mathematical model to simulate the AN/ASN-92 for our F-14. We included all the potential sources of errors contributing to the final precision of the device, and recreated the characteristic behavior of a gimballed INS platform. The result is a set of algorithms providing an authentic representation of the AN/ASN-92 in DCS, yet optimized to have almost no impact on CPU performance.</p>
<p>The main components of the INS are the inertial measurement unit (IMU), the power supply unit, and pilot and RIO navigation controls and displays.</p>
<p>Although from the crew member’s point of view, the INS is used mostly for navigation, it is also essential for proper operations of other aircraft equipment. For example, the attitude is necessary for the radar. The attitude and the own position are required for some weapon delivery modes, particularly for long shots. Even more distressing to the crew, a complete failure of the INS renders the more advanced modes of weapons such as the AIM-7 and AIM-54 missiles inoperable.</p>
<p>The same information is used for data-link operations - when using erroneous INS data, own tracks and targets received from cooperating aircraft will not match and result in false contacts being displayed on the TID. These are only a few examples, and the INS data is used whenever aircraft position or attitude is required.</p>
<p>Thus, the inertial navigation system (INS) integrates with the AWG-9 computer (WCS computer) and the CSDC, the computer signal data converter. Other related equipment includes the attitude and heading reference system, central air data computer, radar altimeter, instrument landing system, and TACAN.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="navigation-system"><a class="header" href="#navigation-system">Navigation System</a></h1>
<h2 id="wcs-computer"><a class="header" href="#wcs-computer">WCS Computer</a></h2>
<p>The WCS or weapon control system computer and CSDC use several alignment routines stored on a magnetic tape to perform the necessary computations to align the INS.</p>
<p>These stored alignment routines in the WCS computer are called SMAL single mode alignment program. When alignment is initiated, the routines are loaded in the computer’s destructive readout memory from magnetic tape.</p>
<p>This process is called “tape read-in” and is represented by an M on the TID. During the alignment of the IMU platform, the WCS communicates with the CSDC to address specific CSDC navigation routines.</p>
<h2 id="imu-platform-alignment"><a class="header" href="#imu-platform-alignment">IMU Platform Alignment</a></h2>
<p>When alignment mode is selected, the IMU platform first erects to a coarse alignment with the help of accelerometer output and gives an aircraft heading that represents the angular displacement from true north. This displacement is referred to as wander angle. The CSDC sends inertial velocity data to the WCS during the alignment process.</p>
<p>The second stage – fine alignment – uses the precise measurement of gyroscope drift to calculate the aircraft’s true heading. This is possible because of the Earth’s rotation. At no point of alignment, is the magnetic heading used, and the whole process relies only on the sensing of the non-inertial movement of the platform within the 3D space.</p>
<p>The WCS calculates terms for platform alignment corrections and estimates the value of the wander angle, then sends this data to the CSDC. The CSDC uses these correction terms in the CSDC inertial equations to generate pulses for the platform torquing that are then transmitted to the IMU. The CSDC in return receives velocity information from the IMU and sends this new inertial velocity data to the WCS alignment program, upon which the cycle repeats. The exchange of data continues until INS is entered.</p>
<p>The leveling process of the platform is achieved by the CSDC generating torquing pulses based on IMU accelerometer off-level indications being sent to the IMU by the CSDC. With each data exchange, the WCS calculates an error value (delta) between the values of the previous and current wander angle. This delta is largest at the beginning of the alignment and smallest at the end of alignment.</p>
<p>The alignment is finished when the delta is near zero and near zero velocity is sensed along the platform X and Y axes. Variable factors required to align the platform are continuously calculated, updated, and saved as calibration data. When the alignment is complete, the system is ready to enter INS. The last used calibration data and wander angle are stored in the CSDC upon entry into INS. When in INS, the WCS accepts the velocity and position data and the wander angle from the CSDC.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-modes"><a class="header" href="#navigation-modes">Navigation Modes</a></h2>
<p>Three navigation data mode sources are used for general navigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>INS</strong> - The primary navigation mode set by the RIO once IMU alignment is complete. The IMU is the primary sensor supplying velocity data that is used to compute all inertial outputs. The IMU is the source for roll and pitch data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IMU/AM</strong> - A backup mode that can either be selected by the RIO or is automatically entered when the CSDC determines the IMU inertial velocity data is unreliable. In this mode, true airspeed from the CADC and stored or entered winds are combined to provide ground speed and true heading for general navigation. The IMU is the source for pitch and roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AHRS/AM</strong> - An even further degraded mode that can be either selected by the RIO or automatically entered when the CSDC detects a total INS failure. Heading in this mode is derived from magnetic heading plus entered or stored magnetic variation (MAG VAR). This heading, TAS from the CADC, and entered or stored wind are used for general navigation. The AHRS is the source of pitch and roll.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="navigation-computations"><a class="header" href="#navigation-computations">Navigation Computations</a></h2>
<p>The CSDC and the WCS are aware of the selected navigation mode. The CSDC sends the WCS navigation data parameters (TAS from the CADC, latitude and longitude, inertial velocities, true heading, etc.) required to support general navigation calculations. The WCS uses stored and input navigation data (based on the current navigation mode) to perform the required navigational computations. The WCS also performs additional computations so that the crew is provided with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current latitude and longitude</li>
<li>Attitude</li>
<li>Heading true and magnetic</li>
<li>Own ground speed and ground track</li>
<li>Ability to store and display three waypoints, a fixed point (FP), an initial point (IP), a surface target (ST), a home base (HB), a defended point, and a hostile area</li>
<li>Range, bearing, command course, command heading, and time-to-go to a selected destination point</li>
<li>Calculated wind speed and direction</li>
<li>Calculated magnetic variation</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring of the status of the unit, and in case of failure inform the crew with advisory lights and appropriate acronyms displayed on the TID</li>
<li>Backup navigation modes in case of partial system failure</li>
<li>Backup present position</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="displays"><a class="header" href="#displays">Displays</a></h2>
<p>Navigation information is displayed on the TID, HSD, multiple display indicator (MDI), HUD, and VDI, depending on the mode selected by the pilot and RIO. If an IMU or navigation computer failure occurs, two backup modes are available: IMU airmass (IMU/AM) or AHRS airmass (AHRS/AM).</p>
<h3 id="navigational-controls"><a class="header" href="#navigational-controls">Navigational Controls</a></h3>
<p>To control the INS, use the navigation control and data readout panel and the computer address panel. See Tactical Information Display (TID) and Associated Controls and Associated Controls and Computer Address Panel (CAP) for a more detailed description.</p>
<p>The desired operation mode, alignment mode, and destination point can be selected at the navigation control and data readout panel. The CAP allows entering navigation data and the selected information to be displayed on the TID. The CATEGORY switch on the lower end of the panel determines the function of the MESSAGE button. The categories used for navigation are NAV and TAC DATA. The STBY and READY advisory lights on the navigation control and data readout panel indicate the status of the alignment program and navigation system.</p>
<p>Failure indicators for the main components of the navigation system are on the caution/advisory light panels in both cockpits, however, the NAV COMP and IMU indicators are only present on the RIO cockpit caution/advisory light panel.</p>
<p>The pilot displays (HUD, VDI, and HSD) and the RIO multiple display indicator are controlled with either the pilot display control panel or the multiple display indicator control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For detailed information on CAP operation, refer to Computer Address Panel (CAP).</p>
<h4 id="navigation-category"><a class="header" href="#navigation-category">Navigation Category</a></h4>
<p>If the CATEGORY switch is in NAV, the following matrix appears in the MESSAGE windows:</p>

<p>Each window has a designated button. Pressing this button tells the WCS computer which function of the matrix to use. If OWN AC, WIND, or MAG VAR is pressed, data can be entered and displayed for each.</p>
<p>Own-aircraft airspeed and magnetic heading are displayed on the TID. If own-aircraft data file is hooked using the TID cursor, heading will be magnetic. If OWN AC button was selected (hooked) via the CAP, own-aircraft true heading, speed (groundspeed), altitude, or course can be displayed on the TID by depressing the appropriate prefix button:</p>
<ul>
<li>LAT or LONG button will display own-aircraft latitude and longitude.</li>
<li>SPD button displays ground speed and magnetic course.</li>
<li>True airspeed and true heading are displayed when the HDG prefix button is depressed.</li>
<li>Altitude is displayed on the left TID readout (right is blank) when the ALT button is used.</li>
<li>When pressing the WIND button, the TID displays present wind speed (left readout) and magnetic direction (right readout).</li>
<li>The MAG VAR button is used for displaying and entering magnetic variation (MAG VAR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to change own-aircraft lat, long, true heading, or altitude, press the according prefix button followed by the desired quantity. During entry, the data is displayed on the upper middle readout on the TID. At the same time, existing data is being displayed on the two lower readouts. If new data is correct, the RIO can press the ENTER button and the new values will appear on the readout.</p>
<p>To change wind data entry, press the WIND button, then either the SPD or HDG prefix button and the appropriate numbers: knots (0 to 512) for speed or degrees (000 to 359) for magnetic direction. The multiple display indicator data readout of WIND direction is always displayed as true.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the INS mode, wind is calculated and updated continuously. The manual entry of wind is ignored by the wind calculations even though the system accepts the entry.</p>
<p>Depressing the MAG VAR button displays alternating values of computed MAG VAR (vC) and manual MAG VAR (vM) on the left readout and displays magnetic heading (MH) on the right readout. The two values alternate every 2 seconds. On the CAP sign/direction buttons, plus (+) corresponds to east variation and minus (-) to west variation.</p>
<p>For manual MAG VAR, press the MAG VAR button. Press HDG, E, or W, the angle in degrees and tenths, and ENTER. Tenths of a degree must be entered even if zero. The TID displays including the NAV GRID will shift appropriately. Computed MAG VAR is constantly calculated in the AWG-9 by comparing the IMU’s true heading with the magnetic heading from AHRS. This difference is saved as computed MAG VAR. The table below shows the MAG VAR source used by the computer for displays and CAP entries.</p>
<p>Computed MAG VAR and manual MAG VAR are compared by the AWG-9 computer. If they differ by a certain value, the acronym MV will alternate with the IN or IM navigation mode acronym on the TID and HSD. The acronym is cleared when the difference falls below 5°.</p>

</div>
<p>If the selection of AHRS/AM occurs and no update (or re-entering of the same value) occurs last vC will be used.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When operating in SLAVED or COMP mode near a magnetic disturbance, such as aboard a carrier, the MV acronym should be expected to appear.</p>
<p>The table below shows error source analysis and response to the MV acronym appearing in flight.</p>

When pressing any one of these MESSAGE buttons, the TID symbol brightens and the activated MESSAGE push button illuminates, indicating a successful hook. The RIO can then use the functions for which hooking was required. Data regarding the hooked point can be displayed on the TID by pressing the according prefix button. Additionally, the latitude, longitude, and altitude of the hooked point can be entered by pressing either the LAT, LONG, or ALT button followed by the desired numbers. Like before, existing data is being displayed on the two lower readouts. If the new data is correct, the RIO can press the ENTER button and the new values will appear on the readout.</p>
<h3 id="navigational-caution-lights"><a class="header" href="#navigational-caution-lights">Navigational Caution Lights</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the NAV COMP, AHRS, and IMU lights mentioned above, the RIO caution/advisory panel contains two other advisory lights, C&amp;D HOT and AWG-9 COND, that are indirectly related to navigation system operation. Illumination of either or both of these lights could mean degraded navigation operation and would require further investigation of the WCS.</p>
<h2 id="radar-altimeter-system-anapn-194"><a class="header" href="#radar-altimeter-system-anapn-194">Radar Altimeter System (AN/APN-194)</a></h2>
<p>The radar altimeter is a low-altitude (0 to 5,000 feet), pulsed, range-tracking radar that measures the surface or terrain clearance below the aircraft. Altitude information is obtained by radiating a short-duration RF pulse from the transmit antenna to the Earth’s surface and measuring elapsed time until RF energy returns through the receiver antenna. The altitude is continuously presented to the pilot on an indicator dial in feet AGL. If either Landing or Take off mode is selected on the PDCP, radar altitude is displayed on the HUD from 0 to 1,400 feet.</p>
<p>The radar altimeter can operate in two modes. In the search mode, the system successively examines increments of range until the complete altitude range is searched for a return signal. When a return signal is detected, the system switches to the track mode and tracks the return signal to provide continuous altitude information.</p>
<p>If the radar altimeter drops out of the track mode, an OFF flag appears and the pointer is hidden by a mask. The altimeter will remain inoperative until a return signal is received, at which point the altimeter will display altitude above ground again. Reliable system operation in the altitude range of 0 to 5,000 feet permits close altitude control at minimum altitudes. The system will operate normally in bank angles up to 45° and in climbs or dives except when the reflected signal is too weak.</p>
<p>The system includes a height indicator (altimeter), a test light on the indicator, a low-altitude warning tone, a radar receiver-transmitter under the forward cockpit, and two antennas (transmit and receive), one on each side of the IR fairing, in the aircraft skin. During descent, the warning tone is heard momentarily when the aircraft passes through the altitude set on the limit index. When the aircraft is below this altitude, the red low-altitude warning light on the indicator will stay on.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If radar altitude is unreliable, only the OFF flag is present.</p>
<p>The radar altimeter has a minimum warmup time of 3 minutes. During warmup, failure indications and erroneous readouts should be disregarded.</p>
<h3 id="radar-altimeter-2"><a class="header" href="#radar-altimeter-2">Radar Altimeter</a></h3>
<p>The only controls for the system are on the Radar Altimeter on the pilot instrument panel. The indicator displays radar altitude above the Earth’s surface on a single-turn dial that is calibrated from 0 to 5,000 feet in decreasing scale to provide greater definition at lower altitudes. The control knob in the lower left corner of the indicator is a combination power switch, self-test switch, and positioning control for the low-altitude limit bug.</p>
<h3 id="altimeter-bit"><a class="header" href="#altimeter-bit">Altimeter BIT</a></h3>
<p>To energize the self-test circuitry press and hold the control knob and the green test light will illuminate, the indicator will read 100 ±10 feet, and the HUD altitude scale should read approximately 100 feet. If the indicator passes below the altimeter limit bug setting, the aural and visual warnings are triggered. To resume normal operation simply release the control knob again.</p>
<h3 id="low-altitude-audio-warning"><a class="header" href="#low-altitude-audio-warning">Low-Altitude Audio Warning</a></h3>
<p>A low-altitude 1,000-Hz tone provides an aural warning, modulated at two pulses per second, lasting for 3 seconds. The tone is played to both crew members when the aircraft descends below the altitude set on the low-altitude limit bug.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-system-integration"><a class="header" href="#navigation-system-integration">Navigation System Integration</a></h2>
<h3 id="navigational-modes"><a class="header" href="#navigational-modes">Navigational Modes</a></h3>
<p>Three navigational modes exist in the F-14:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Inertial Navigation Mode (INS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Achieved by the INS, employing the IMU (and PSU) and the CSDC.</li>
<li>Provides the flight crew with own-aircraft position, velocity, attitude, and heading information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inertial Measurement Unit/Airmass Mode (IMU/AM)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Serves as a backup navigation mode.</li>
<li>Entry into this mode permanently degrades INS platform heading alignment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AHRS/Air Mass Mode (AHRS/AM)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizes the AHRS attitude and heading information in place of the IMU.</li>
<li>Serves as an additional backup mode if both INS and IMU/AM modes fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="inertial-navigation-mode"><a class="header" href="#inertial-navigation-mode">Inertial Navigation Mode</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>INS mode should be entered following an alignment.</li>
<li>READY light illuminates in GND and CVA alignment positions and stays on after launch in CAT alignment, indicating completion of alignment.</li>
<li>If the INS mode is selected, both the STBY and READY lights will go out. However, if the INS mode is selected before the caret turns into a diamond, both the STBY and READY lights will illuminate, and the system will revert to the IMU/AM backup mode.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="outputs-provided-by-imu-and-csdc-in-ins-mode"><a class="header" href="#outputs-provided-by-imu-and-csdc-in-ins-mode">Outputs provided by IMU and CSDC in INS mode:</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aircraft latitude and longitude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aircraft magnetic or true heading (depending on CAP prefix button selected)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System altitude (barometric damped inertial altitude)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platform wander angle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Velocity components (x, y, z)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical acceleration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aircraft magnetic heading is derived from the AHRS. If the AHRS fails, magnetic heading is derived by subtracting the MAG VAR from the true heading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TID can display latitude, longitude, ground speed, ground track, true airspeed, wind (speed and direction), MAG VAR, altitude, and aircraft true or magnetic heading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WCS computer makes calculations in true north coordinates for steering and uses the magnetic heading input from the AHRS to update the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wind is computed from the difference between inertial velocities and air mass velocities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WCS and CSDC also provide the steering and cueing functions required for display to the flight crew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Destination or navigation points include waypoints 1, 2, or 3, fixed point, home base, surface target, and initial point, which may be designated by the DEST switch on the TID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigational points (latitude and longitude) can also be inserted by the RIO using the CAP or by datalink message (when on the deck) using either cable or the RF link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The course to set (heading to a selected navigational point), range, bearing, and time-to-go to a point are based on great circle calculations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If INS fails, the RIO should verify MAG VAR calculated and WIND data and update via manual entries as required.</p>
<h3 id="imuam-navigation-mode"><a class="header" href="#imuam-navigation-mode">IMU/AM Navigation Mode</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If a failure of the navigation computer section of the CSDC or certain failures in the IMU are detected, the IMU/AM mode is entered automatically.</li>
<li>Failures are indicated by the STBY and READY lights illuminating and the NAV COMP light illuminating on the RIO CAUTION/ADVISORY panel.</li>
<li>The switch to IMU/AM is indicated by the IN acronym on the TID and HSD changing to IM. The RIO should select IMU/AM on the NAV MODE switch to extinguish the STBY and READY lights.</li>
<li>The IMU/AM mode can be entered manually by selecting IMU/AM with the NAV MODE switch.</li>
<li>If the switch is turned off before selecting IMU/AM mode, the computer cannot enter the IMU/AM mode for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. During this time, the aircraft must remain stationary on the ground or in level unaccelerated flight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If an alignment past coarse exists with no NAV COMP failure and the RIO switches to IMU/AM, the READY light will flash, indicating that if the switch is not returned to INS within 5 seconds the INS mode cannot be re-entered without completing a new alignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The WCS computer performs dead-reckoning navigation in the IMU/AM mode, using heading information from the IMU and true airspeed from the CADC.</li>
<li>Wind can be applied by either using the wind last computed in the INS mode or wind data manually entered through the CAP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After entering the IMU/AM mode, check wind and MAG VAR values. If MV is in error, enter own-aircraft true heading. If winds are in error, update.</p>
<h4 id="imu-reset-procedure"><a class="header" href="#imu-reset-procedure">IMU Reset Procedure</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>NAV MODE switch - OFF, for a few seconds.</li>
<li>NAV MODE switch - IMU.</li>
<li>Fly straight and level for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Verify IM acronym.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ahrsair-mass-mode"><a class="header" href="#ahrsair-mass-mode">AHRS/Air Mass Mode</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The AHRS/AM mode is another backup mode for navigation. It uses the last known aircraft position, either from the last navigation computer value or by manual data entry from the RIO. It then extrapolates the present position of the aircraft.</li>
<li>AHRS/AM mode is automatically selected if the IMU fails or by switching to AHRS/AM on the NAV MODE switch. An IMU failure is indicated by the STBY and READY status lights and the IMU advisory light illuminating. Additionally, the attitude status readout on the TID changes to AH.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The navigation mode will not automatically switch to AHRS/AM upon an IMU failure when the navigation system is in IMU/AM mode with a failed IMU quantizer and NAV COMP advisory light illuminated. Because the VDIG/TID/DDD are displaying invalid IMU attitudes, the NAV MODE switch should be moved to AHRS/AM.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the navigation mode automatically switches to AHRS when the IMU fails, the STBY and READY lights will remain on until the RIO selects AHRS/AM on the NAV MODE switch.</p>
<ul>
<li>When AHRS/AM is selected on the NAV MODE switch, the AHRS provides heading information required for DR navigation in place of the IMU platform and the CSDC provides barometric altitude, altitude rate, and true airspeed as in the IMU/AM mode.</li>
<li>To update wind speed and direction and magnetic variation, use the CAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AHRS can be operated in any of three subheading modes selected on the compass controller panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SLAVED</strong> - Magnetic north referenced (flux value), directional gyro is slaved to flux value, used where reliable magnetic heading reference is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DG</strong> - Free azimuth gyro, compensated for drift because of Earth’s (polar operations), used where magnetic reference is unreliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>COMP</strong> - Magnetic north reference direct (flux value), no gyro damping. The HUD, VDI, HSD, and multiple display indicator use manual magnetic variation (vM) automatically in this mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RIO can switch from either INS mode to AHRS/AM mode or from IMU/AM mode to AHRS/AM mode for comparison, without fear of degradation, since the AHRS is a separate system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This cannot be done with the INS and IMU/AM modes since the IMU is used in both cases and it would result in permanent degradation to the IMU alignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an IMU failure, the nav system will automatically operate in the AHRS/AM mode with the navigation and data readout panel in INS, as long as the WCS computer receives heading from the AHRS and airspeed from the CADC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If takeoff is performed in the AHRS/AM mode, MAG VAR and WIND must be manually inserted via CAP for proper navigation computations.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the platform is aligned and the AHRS/AM backup navigation mode is selected, the STBY light is off but the READY light is on, indicating that the inertial navigation mode can be selected if desired. The same functions and outputs for display are computed as in INS, however since different inputs are used for some calculations a degraded navigation performance is to be expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steering"><a class="header" href="#steering">Steering</a></h3>
<p>There are two basic types of steering: navigation and attack. Attack steering modes will be covered in the Weapons and Weapons Employment overview.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation steering is computed on either a great circle course or rhumb line to a fixed point on the Earth’s surface or as a deviation from a selected course or heading.</li>
<li>The point used for steering can be the RIO’s selected destination (three waypoints, fixed point, identification point, surface target, or home base), a TACAN station, ADF information, ACLS information, or a data link waypoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flight-modes-and-steering-submodes"><a class="header" href="#flight-modes-and-steering-submodes">Flight Modes and Steering Submodes</a></h3>
<p>The pilot can choose between five VDIG display formats (HUD modes) on the pilot display control panel. These five flight modes are arranged as five vertical, mutually exclusive buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take Off (T.O.)</li>
<li>Cruise (CRUISE)</li>
<li>Air to Air (A/A)</li>
<li>Air to Ground (A/G)</li>
<li>Landing (LDG)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> ACM cover open selection overrides all modes, except the T.O. and LDG modes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from the VDIG displays, the flight mode selections also control AFCS, armament, and WCS logic. In addition to the essential data such as altitude, vertical speed indicator etc. the VDIG format also provides steering cues.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of the flight modes, the pilot can choose between the following five types of steering commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TACAN (TACAN)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Destination (DEST)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWL/PCD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector (VEC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manual (MAN)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The five selections are arranged horizontally along the bottom of the PDCP. These steering modes determine the display format on the pilot HSD and the RIO multiple display indicator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HSD and multiple display indicator present, in a horizontal plane, steering to the selected point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HSD follows the five submodes when the pilot places the HSD-MODE switch to NAV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RIO can do the same by setting the MODE switch on his multiple display indicator control panel to NAV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, when LDG is selected, the pilot has the option of displaying ICLS or ACL information via switches on the PDCP that can be used to individually and independently select the HUD and VDI for display. A typical choice would be to select ICLS (SPN-41 /ARA-63) for the HUD and for D/L the VDI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A/A (air-to-air) and A/G (air-to-ground) modes are further explained in the Weapons and Weapons Employment overview.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The STEERING indicator drum on the navigation control and data readout panel provides a readout for the RIO to inform him of what steering submode the pilot bas chosen.</p>
<h3 id="takeoff-steering"><a class="header" href="#takeoff-steering">Takeoff Steering</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>To enter the takeoff steering mode, press the T.O. button on the display control panel. The VDIG will display a vertical speed indicator on the left side and an altitude scale on the right side in the HUD.</li>
<li>Before takeoff, the pilot should check the magnetic heading on top of the HUD and VDI against a known reference (i.e., runway heading and most importantly BRC on the carrier, due to the large magnetic distortion on the ship). The vertical speed indicator should be used to verify a positive climb after takeoff.</li>
<li>After takeoff, the navigation system normally computes wind and magnetic variation, which are needed for steering. For backup modes, the WCS uses the last computed or RIO-entered wind speed, direction, and magnetic variation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="take-off-tacan-steering"><a class="header" href="#take-off-tacan-steering">Take-Off-TACAN Steering</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The TACAN steering submode works the same, whether used for takeoff, cruise, or landing, by providing the pilot with a TACAN deviation.</li>
<li>The pilot can set the course or TACAN radial with the CRS control on the HSD. The TACAN displays are available on the HUD, VDI, HSD, and multiple display indicator. The HSD and the CMD display TACAN range and the relative bearing to a selected TACAN station.</li>
<li>To enter the submode, press the TACAN button on the PDCP. After selection of TACAN course, the HUD and VDI display the TACAN deviation symbol and a TO and FROM symbology.</li>
<li>On the HSD and multiple display indicator, an arrow on the deviation bar pointing in the same direction as the TACAN course indicates a course toward the station, an arrow pointing in the opposite direction indicates a course away from the station. On the HUD, a dashed line indicates FROM, a solid line indicates TO. On the VDI, a dark bar indicates FROM, a bright bar indicates TO.</li>
<li>On the HUD, the deviation symbol moves 3° (linear) in the field of view for a 6° deviation from the selected TACAN radial. These limits prevent the symbol from leaving the field of view or interfering with the scales on the left and right side. On the VDI, the deviation symbol is scaled to move 1.5 inches (linear) for a 6° deviation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="takeoff-manual-steering"><a class="header" href="#takeoff-manual-steering">Takeoff Manual Steering</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The manual steering mode is similar to the basic takeoff mode.</li>
<li>The mode is entered by pressing the MAN button and selecting a desired course with the CRS control on the HSD.</li>

<li>To enter the landing steering mode, press the LDG button on the PDCP.</li>
<li>Usually, the LDG mode is engaged at any point from marshal point on. In the case of a go-around, waveoff, or bolter, the pilot can press the T.O. button on the PDCP to engage the take-off steering mode.</li>
<li>The landing mode symbology is in general the same as the takeoff mode symbology.

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In all landing submodes, a VDIG breakaway symbol can be displayed upon receipt of a D/L waveoff message.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are three steering submodes available during landing: TACAN, VEC, and AWL/PCD.</li>
<li>For the TACAN or VEC submodes of LDG, the HUD, VDI, and HSD displays are similar to the same submodes in CRUISE except that in LDG the HUD display includes the velocity vector symbol, the radar altitude symbol, and the vertical speed indicator symbol.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="inertial-navigation-system-ins"><a class="header" href="#inertial-navigation-system-ins">Inertial Navigation System (INS)</a></h2>
<p>An important feature of the INS is its fast alignment capability over a wide range of temperatures. The INS is a dead-reckoning system that derives speed as a function of aircraft accelerations. Two accelerometers are used to measure acceleration in the horizontal plane. These outputs result in velocities along the X and Y axes after corrections for the Earth’s rotational velocity (Coriolis acceleration) and integration inputs. These X and Y velocities can be resolved in the IMU platform coordinate system through wander angle and put in the Earth-referenced north/east/down system. Integration about the north and east axes also provides increments of latitude and longitude. Navigation in such a manner gives the flight crew detailed and precise knowledge of the position, direction, and velocity of their aircraft at any time.</p>
<p>An INS device like the AN/ASN-92 requires a high precision of measurements of the acceleration and the attitude, because even the smallest inaccuracy can result in a significant error when accumulated over extended time.</p>
<p>Consider an example: the inertial platform is slightly tilted from the nominal position, let’s say by 0.002°. Then, the horizontal accelerometers are no longer parallel to the ground, and this means that they start to be sensitive to gravity. If not corrected, this gravitational component is interpreted by the navigation computer as a horizontal acceleration. If the wrong attitude is kept constant for one hour, it will result in an error of the measured position of over one nautical mile. It is a significant inaccuracy, and it comes as a result of such a minimal alignment error.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the INS degrades with time – usually the longer they operate in the navigation mode, the higher the error they accumulate.</p>
<h2 id="inertial-measurement-unit"><a class="header" href="#inertial-measurement-unit">Inertial Measurement Unit</a></h2>
<p>The IMU is a three-axis, four-gimbal, all-attitude unit containing two gyros and three accelerometers. The gyros and the accelerometers are mounted to a platform that is free to rotate with respect to the base (aircraft). The four-gimbal system provides gimbal-lock free rotation and uses torquer motors to correct platform attitude errors. The gyros sense angular rotation about their sensitive axes and are the source of information about the aircraft attitude. They also stabilize the whole platform and keep the constant orientation of the accelerometers with respect to the ground (gravity). Two accelerometers are used to measure acceleration in the horizontal plane; the third accelerometer measures vertical acceleration. The sensitive axes of the accelerometers are orthogonal. Their displacement is sensed by pickoff coils that develop a signal that is amplified, then applied to a torquer that restores the mass to its null position. The magnitude of torquing current required is proportional to the acceleration. The sensed acceleration signal is integrated in the computer and used to calculate aircraft velocity and displacement from the initial position. The attitude of the platform is also corrected continuously to account for the effects associated with the Earth’s rotation and device inaccuracies.</p>
<p>This design is widespread for gimballed inertial navigation systems. It was used for the F-14, but also for the Space Shuttle and many other aircraft of the era.</p>
<h2 id="imu-bit"><a class="header" href="#imu-bit">IMU BIT</a></h2>
<p>In case of IMU failure, the CSDC automatically switches to a backup navigation mode. The IMU BIT monitors the temperature, internal error signals, and electrical characteristics of the IMU.</p>
<p>If the CSDC detects a failure in the IMU, it informs the WCS computer and the IMU acronym indicating the component of the INS that failed is displayed on the TID. The IMU advisory light illuminates on the RIO caution/advisory panel.</p>
<h2 id="nav-comp-light"><a class="header" href="#nav-comp-light">NAV COMP Light</a></h2>
<p>If the NAV MODE switch is in INS, and the NAV COMP light illuminates, there is a failure in the INS or CSDC; the navigation system will automatically switch to a backup mode. The NAV COMP light remains illuminated and the RIO should set the NAV MODE switch to IMU/AM position. The NAV COMP advisory light indicates that the INS is operating in a degraded mode as a result of manual selection by the RIO using the NAV MODE switch or automatic selection because of a failure of the CSDC or the IMU.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When an IMU quantizer failure occurs in the INS mode, the system will automatically select the IMU/AM mode and the STBY/READY and NAV COMP lights will illuminate. The RIO should move the NAV MODE switch from the INS to IMU/AM. The STBY/READY lights go out - but the NAV COMP light will remain illuminated.</p>
<p>With a NAV COMP light and a CSI ACRO displayed on the TID, there is no auto-switch to a backup attitude source for the HUD or the VDI nor is the RIO able to manually switch to any backup mode.</p>
<h2 id="imu-light"><a class="header" href="#imu-light">IMU Light</a></h2>
<p>If there is a failure in the IMU, the IMU advisory light will illuminate; the navigation system switches to the AHRS/AM mode and accuracy may become degraded. Attitude information for the VDIG and missile control system are now provided by the AHRS. The IMU light remains illuminated until the RIO selects AHRS/AM. With an AHRS light, computed magnetic variation (vC) should be verified and updated if necessary.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Standby light</th><th>Ready light</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>ON</td><td>ON</td><td>Selected navigational mode not functioning correctly due to failure. Normal during first 45 seconds of alignment initialization.</td></tr>

</div>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> After RIO selection IMU/AM because of a failure, and a complete IMU failure occurs afterward, the system will display erroneous attitude information to the pilot. The CSDC will neither automatically exit IMU/AM to the AHRS/AM mode (if a valid AHRS exists) nor remove VDIG/TID/DDD attitude displays. The RIO should manually switch to the AHRS/AM mode.</p>
<p>Whenever the NAV COMP light illuminates the flight crew should be cautious of attitude displays and frequently cross-reference the VDIG/TID/DDD and standby attitude indicator, particularly during non-VFR conditions and be alert for an IMU failure. If an IMU failure is indicated by the IMU light, display of IMU acronym in OBC continuous monitor, removal of the IM acronym in the TID attitude reference source buffer, and the NAV COMP light goes out, the RIO should move the NAV MODE switch from the IMU/AM to the AHRS/AM and disregard the READY light. If a valid AHRS exists, its attitude information will be displayed, otherwise the VDIG/TID/DDD attitude displays will be removed.</p>
<h2 id="ahrs-light"><a class="header" href="#ahrs-light">AHRS Light</a></h2>
<p>If the AHRS self-test has detected a failure the AHRS Light will illuminate. The magnetic heading on the HUD and VDI is now controlled by the WCS computer. Because it uses the last known value for magnetic variation, the heading will degrade over long distances and time unless new values of magnetic variation are entered by the RIO via the CAP. IFR flight should be avoided completely.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-power-supply"><a class="header" href="#navigation-power-supply">Navigation Power Supply</a></h2>
<p>The NPS provides electrical power for the IMU and CSDC. A nickel-cadmium battery provides power to the IMU and CSDC for up to 10 seconds if there is a power interruption or transient.</p>
<h2 id="ins-alignment-modes"><a class="header" href="#ins-alignment-modes">INS Alignment Modes</a></h2>
<p>Before INS can be used for navigation, the inertial platform must be aligned so that it is level relative to local vertical and its orientation relative to true north. This is done automatically in two phases: coarse alignment and fine alignment.</p>
<p>The coarse phase begins when the initialization sequence is complete and performs initial coarse estimates of the IMU platform wander angle. The successful completion of this phase requires a minimum local level error in the IMU platform to proceed to the fine alignment phase.</p>
<p>IMU elements that require warmup are being heated by the IMU heaters. In addition, the IMU gimbals (roll, pitch, azimuth) are caged through their respective synchros to the IMU case (airframe reference). The IMU gyros are brought up to running speed, and coarse leveling is performed using the accelerometer outputs.</p>
<p>When power is applied to the NPS and IMU, the SMAL program from the bulk storage tape is read into the WCS computer nonwrite-protected memory. The alignment program estimates a wander angle, velocity errors, and gyro-torquing correction signals.</p>
<p>These values are sent to the CSDC to align the IMU and to initialize the CSDC NAV program. The following assemblies are used during alignment: IMU, NPS, CSDC, WCS computer, CAP (computer address panel), navigation control and data readout panel. For carrier alignment, the data link receiver-processor is also used.</p>
<p>There are four primary alignment modes: SAT ground and carrier alignment, and NON SAT ground and carrier alignment. SAT operation allows OBC testing during the alignment. Either alignment mode can be used in SAT or NON SAT. (SAT modes are not yet implemented in DCS)</p>
<p>The basic TID display formats are represented in the image below. The automatic sequence is the same for all modes, except for CVA ALIGN, where the ship’s motion is inserted by the data link.</p>
<p>The CAT ALIGN overrides the requirement for the parking brake to be on (suspend align). There are two more alignment submodes: stored heading and handset. The handset mode is used for CVA ALIGN when SINS data is not available. The stored heading mode is used for rapid alignment, by using a previous alignment (reference alignment) to align the system quickly.</p>
<p>Initialization of any alignment mode requires entry of the following values in either own aircraft or HB (homebase) for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>Longitude</li>
<li>Corrected pressure altitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if handset alignment is used on the carrier, the following values must also be entered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Ship’s true heading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The parking brake must be on during initialization of any alignment. When the parking brake is released during coarse alignment, the STBY and READY lights flash and the align program will reinitialize. If the parking brake is released during fine alignment, a suspend align discrete is sent to the CSDC, the STBY or READY light blinks, and the time into alignment clock on the TID stops.</p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/images/align.png" alt="Alignment Display" /></p>
<h3 id="non-sat-alignments"><a class="header" href="#non-sat-alignments">Non-SAT Alignments</a></h3>
<h4 id="ground-alignment"><a class="header" href="#ground-alignment">Ground Alignment</a></h4>
<p>For land-based operations, the ground alignment procedure is used to align the IMU. Aircraft or homebase latitude, longitude, and altitude are entered into the WCS computer via the CAP. This may be accomplished before or after selecting GND align. Selecting GND ALIGN on the NAV MODE switch initiates the align operation. However, note that whatever has been hooked when switching to ALIGN, is injected as your own coordinates. You can use homebase or preset own aircraft coordinates for example, but if you didn’t, you will have between 90 to 120 seconds to enter your own coordinates and you cannot wait for the alignment to finish, or it will trigger the observable error (O) and alignment will have to be reinitialized.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If fine align has not been achieved, entry of the own aircraft’s latitude will restart the alignment. On completion of the alignment program read-in, the alignment display appears on the TID.</p>
<p>During the initialization, the TID will display an alignment time of 0.7. After 42 to 45 seconds, the NAV COMP light on the caution/advisory panel goes out, indicating that the IMU has entered the ready state; the READY light also goes out. The alignment program will begin with the computation of the alignment parameters.</p>
<p>At this time, an alignment status indicator, called a caret (v), will start to move from left to right. The status of the alignment is indicated by where the caret appears in relationship to three alignment-tick indicators. The first tick indicator is called the coarse-align complete marker, the second is the alert launch criteria marker, and the third indicator is the fine-align complete marker. An elapsed time indicator provides alignment time in minutes and tenths.</p>
<p>The clock indicator will begin with 0.7 displayed and continue after a 42-second delay. After 9.9 minutes, the clock display will pass through zero and begin again. If the alignment is suspended (parking brake), the clock will stop counting until alignment is resumed.</p>
<p>Between the first and second ticks are the telltale status indicators that indicate a failure of one of four systems: C = calibration data fail, T = temperature (cold IMU), S = SINS data invalid, and 0 = observable (alignment data bad, i.e., LAT, LONG, SPEED, etc.). The letter that appears indicates which system has a failure.</p>
<p>A C indicates a failure in the transfer of calibration data between the IMU and the CSDC, and the alignment will not progress.</p>
<p>The T appears normally at the start of alignment and disappears when the IMU has reached operating temperature. If the T does not disappear, there is a failure in the system and a non-stored heading alignment will not progress.</p>
<p>The S can appear at the start of any CV alignment and will disappear shortly after. If the S does not disappear, there is a failure and the result will be a bad alignment. The S also appears if incoming SINS data is not valid, in which case the alignment should not be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The CSDC and IMU outputs as well as data inputs are constantly monitored and if either an excessive value in the X or Y acceleration is sensed, or a bad value from wrong lat or long data input, a 0 (bad observable) is posted on the TID and the alignment stalls (ceases to continue).</p>
<p>The IMU may be preheated by selecting IMU/AM on the TID NAV MODE switch when operating on ground or aircraft power. This energizes the IMU and navigation power supply, which turns on the IMU heater prior to start of a ground or carrier alignment. The IMU should not be preheated for longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>During coarse alignment, the alignment caret moves based on the wander angle error. If the parking brake is released during this phase, the alignment will reset.</p>
<p>The V will reach the first tick when coarse alignment is complete. When the program switches to fine alignment, the caret changes into a diamond, which indicates to the pilot that he may release the parking brake (suspend alignment) and taxi, if OBC is complete. After the parking brake is reset, alignment will continue and the diamond will move right as alignment improves.</p>
<p>At the second tick, which indicates that alignment meets the minimum criteria to launch weapons, the STBY light will go off and the READY light will illuminate. The INS mode may be entered at this point. If INS is not selected, the diamond continues to move to the right. When it reaches the third tick, it indicates that fine alignment is completed and a dot will appear in the diamond (&lt;&gt;).</p>
<p>You can leave the system in alignment mode even after fine align is complete, which will provide a progressively more accurate alignment. How much more accuracy is gained depends on the quality of alignment when fine align was completed. This can be rather minimal in some cases, but, when it is further left in alignment for long enough, it will always provide a certain amount of improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If alignment is suspended and the aircraft is taxied over a distance greater than 4000 feet, the quality of the alignment becomes unknown to a point where it might be unreliable. Alignment reinitialization is advised.</p>
<p>If the caret (v) or diamond stop moving, the program has stopped aligning. If they stop between the first and third ticks (coarse and fine), it means that alignment has been suspended. The clock will stop counting if that is the case. If alignment continues, the clock resumes counting until switched out of alignment by NAV MODE switch or if the parking brake is released again.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The alignment display will not go past the coarse align tick until the IMU temperature has reached 165°. When this temperature is reached, the T symbol will disappear. The temperature interlock is bypassed when performing a stored heading alignment. The IMU should be preheated for a stored heading alignment, as it usually completes in under 2 minutes, which could result in a bad alignment.</p>
<p>Selecting INS will turn off the READY light, terminate alignment and the tactical display will appear, and the normal navigation display will become available.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the NAV MODE switch is set to INS, the CSDC is in navigation mode and the READY light goes out.</p>
<p>After selecting the INS navigation mode, the AWG-9 align program continues for approximately three align data cycles (18 seconds) before entering INS. This also applies if the aircraft takes off before INS is selected.</p>
<p>The RIO and pilot can then observe an IN acronym on the attitude status readout on the TID or TID repeat.</p>
<p>If you want to reinitialize an alignment when observing an acronym during fine alignment or if noting a stalled alignment, the following methods can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select both INS mode switch and WCS PWR switch to off. Allow TID displays to collapse. Proceed with normal start sequence.</li>
<li>INS mode switch to desired align mode.</li>
<li>INS mode switch to INS. Verify system in INS (IN acronym on TID), cycle mode switch to off and back to desired alignment mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to follow above procedures when reinitializing a fine alignment will result in severely degraded alignment quality. To reinitialize the program during coarse align, the RIO has to unselect GND ALIGN, re-enter LAT and LONG and reselect GND ALIGN.</p>
<h4 id="carrier-alignment"><a class="header" href="#carrier-alignment">Carrier Alignment</a></h4>
<p>When aligning on a carrier with a changing latitude, longitude, and heading, the carrier alignment procedure is used. INS can be aligned in three different ways on a carrier: with RF data link alignment and manual (handset) alignment - deck-edge cable alignment is not implemented in DCS. TID displays the same information as during a GND ALIGN procedure.</p>
<p>Note that you will get erroneous heading readings on a carrier, even if fine align is complete. The heading can deviate up to 20 or 30 degrees, depending on the parking position on the carrier and the carrier’s heading, due to the carrier’s own magnetic field and induced magnetic field. It is important that the flight crew know the carrier’s BRC. The magnetic variation caused by the carrier’s magnetic distortion will go away shortly after take off. This magnetic distortion does not impact the alignment quality.</p>
<h4 id="carrier-data-link-alignment"><a class="header" href="#carrier-data-link-alignment">Carrier Data Link Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The primary carrier alignment mode is the RF data link alignment (CAINS). This mode uses the ship’s INS (SINS) to align the IMU. Inertial inputs including the ship’s longitude, latitude, north and east velocity as well as roll, pitch, heading, and heading rate are transmitted to the WCS computer via the RF data link.</p>
<p>The data is transmitted by the ship’s data link equipment. To align the INS by the CVA alignment method, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on the power to the data link system</li>
<li>Turn the WCS power to STBY</li>
<li>Set the D/L mode on the DATA LINK control panel to CAINS/WAYPT</li>
<li>Select CVA ALIGN on the NAV MODE switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The received data is processed by the data link equipment in the aircraft and transmitted to the WCS computer. The WCS computer compares the IMU data with the ship’s INS data and sends correction signals to the CSDC to fine align the IMU.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If CVA or CAT ALIGN is selected prior to selecting OBC BIT, data link OBC testing is inhibited. (Not implemented yet)</p>
<p>The fine alignment complete tick mark indicates completion of fine align and whether alignment data is SINS or handset. When good SINS data is not received during a filter cycle, the fine alignment complete tick mark jumps to the left approximately 0.75 inches. The jump indicates the SINS data is intermittent, and handset alignment data is required.</p>
<p>CVA ALIGN is much similar to GND ALIGN, and alignment is suspended, stalled, and reinitialized in the same manner as during GND ALIGN, depending on whether it has been induced during the coarse or fine alignment phase.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If SINS data link is lost during taxi, a flashing HS will appear on the TID. This will disappear when data link is reacquired; however, because of align timing requirements, it may remain flashing up to 8 seconds after data link is reacquired. If the HS flashing does not stop 8 seconds after resetting the parking brake, SINS data is lost but the alignment can continue by entering carrier speed and true heading into the own aircraft file and completing the align in handset mode. If datalink is reacquired during this period, the HS will disappear from the TID and a normal datalink CVA align will continue.</p>
<p>To complete the alignment, set the NAV MODE switch to INS. A successfully aligned INS is indicated by both the STBY and READY lights off and the IN acronym in the status readout on the TID.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not switch to INS while the ship is in a turn, even if fine align has been completed. This will degrade the alignment quality significantly. If you wait until the ship’s turn is complete, alignment quality will not be affected. Handset alignment is not affected.</p>
<p>If during a CVA alignment the CAINS/WAYPT-TAC switch is unlatched to TAC by power transient, or data link signal is lost, the INS will revert to a handset alignment (HS).</p>
<h4 id="carrier-cable-alignment"><a class="header" href="#carrier-cable-alignment">Carrier Cable Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The deck-edge cable alignment (SINS) is an alternative to the RF data link alignment, where inputs are sent over a secure cable to the data link from the deck-edge outlet box of the carrier. Switching from RF data link to cable inputs is done automatically when the cable is connected. To initiate a CVA align with SINS via cable, use the same steps as for the RF data link alignment. As cable and RF data link alignment are virtually the same, it has not been implemented in DCS.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The SINS-cable is currently not implemented in DCS.</p>
<h4 id="handset-alignment"><a class="header" href="#handset-alignment">Handset Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The HS alignment mode is a manual alignment option available for carrier alignment, should SINS data from RF data link or cable not be available, inaccurate, or interrupted (indicated by the TILT light on the DDI and/or the fine alignment complete tick mark jumping to the left about 0.75 inches). The HS is also very similar to the GND ALIGN mode, but the RIO has to input more data and the computer takes longer to process because of the ship movement.</p>
<p>IF CVA ALIGN is selected with the NAV MODE switch and no SINS data is available, a flashing HS acronym will appear on the TID. Whenever HS flashes on the TID before alignment starts and the RIO chooses to align the system with handset align, he must enter the according ship’s data in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Ship’s true heading</li>
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>Longitude</li>
<li>Corrected pressure altitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>If during coarse align data link is lost (RF or cable) or during any portion of a stored heading alignment, the alignment will reinitialize and the HS acronym will be flashing. The alignment can then be continued with the handset mode as described above.</p>
<p>If the reinitialization occurs during the fine align phase of a stored heading alignment, the CSDC alignment routine must be reset first by turning the AWG-9 OFF for 6 seconds.</p>
<p>If data link is lost during a normal fine align phase, HS will be entered automatically, but the acronym will not flash and the alignment will continue. If data link is regained, the HS acronym will disappear and normal CVA align via RF or cable data link will continue. When data link is regained, the acronym can remain for up to 8 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If HS is not flashing, valid SINS data has already been entered. If it is flashing, SINS data has to be entered manually.</p>
<p>On the CAP NAV DATA matrix use OWN AC, and the LAT and LONG prefix push buttons; to enter the ships’ heading and speed use own-aircraft HDG and SPD buttons. Once this data has been entered HS will stop flashing and the alignment will progress like a normal GND ALIGN, but can take up to 3 times as long.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The carrier needs to maintain a constant speed and heading during alignment for this method to be successful. Remember that handset alignment quality will always be inferior to a normal CVA ALIGN fine alignment quality.</p>
<h4 id="reinitialization"><a class="header" href="#reinitialization">Reinitialization</a></h4>
<p>To reinitialize an alignment during the fine align phase, if an observable acronym (O) or a stalled alignment has been noticed, the RIO can use any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set NAV MODE switch and WCS switch to OFF. Allow TID displays to collapse. Proceed with normal start sequence.</li>
<li>Set NAV MODE switch to OFF. Set NAV MODE switch to desired align mode.</li>
<li>Set NAV MODE switch to INS. Verify system in INS (IN acronym on TID). Cycle NAV MODE switch to OFF and back to desired alignment mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to follow above procedures when reinitializing a fine alignment will result in severely degraded alignment quality. To reinitialize the program during coarse align, the RIO has to unselect GND ALIGN, re-enter LAT and LONG and reselect GND ALIGN.</p>
<h4 id="stored-heading-alignment"><a class="header" href="#stored-heading-alignment">Stored Heading Alignment</a></h4>
<p>A feature of the INS that allows for quick-reaction response is the stored-heading alignment. The aircraft has to be parked and tied down in the alert position (wheel-chocks in DCS) for this procedure to be successful. Additionally, the aircraft heading has to be stored with a reference alignment before the aircraft is being powered down (and back up again).</p>
<p>When the aircraft is powered back up, the system takes less than 2 minutes to align the INS from the stored heading, while providing almost the same accuracy like a full, fine ground or carrier alignment. When align is selected and a reference alignment is available, an ASH acronym for automatic stored heading will be displayed on the TID and STORED HDG ALIGN will illuminate on the CAP. The ASH acronym tells the RIO that a stored heading has been entered automatically.</p>
<p>No further action from the RIO is needed, ASH align will continue and ASH will remain on the TID as an advisory. Pressing once on the STORED HDG ALIGN on the CAP will end the ASH align and initiate normal alignment. The ASH acronym will disappear. Pressing the STORED HDG ALIGN a second time will reinitialize the stored heading alignment, however ASH won’t be displayed on the TID anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> STBY/READY lights should be monitored for simultaneous illumination. If simultaneous illumination appears after 42 to 45 seconds, a failure has caused the alignment to reinitiate and may result in an erroneous alignment. The RIO must turn NAV MODE switch to OFF for 1 second, then restart the alignment following normal ground or carrier alignment procedures.</p>
<p>The reference alignment can be done with either internal or external power. To do a reference alignment, enter the latitude and longitude via the CAP into the own-aircraft file. This can be achieved by an automatic transfer from homebase entry into own-aircraft before selecting GND ALIGN, or entry into own-aircraft file after GND ALIGN has been selected.</p>
<p>The aircraft’s latitude and longitude can be entered into homebase and transferred into own-aircraft file through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the NAV MODE switch to GND ALIGN.</li>
<li>Select CAP category TAC DATA.</li>
<li>Depress HOME BASE and enter aircraft longitude and latitude via the CAP data entry buttons.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aircraft latitude and longitude can be entered directly through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the NAV MODE switch to either OFF or GND ALIGN.</li>
<li>Select CAP category NAV.</li>
<li>Depress OWN A/C and enter aircraft longitude and latitude via the CAP data entry buttons.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depressing OWN A/C hooks own aircraft. If longitude and latitude is entered with the NAV MODE switch set to OFF, own aircraft must be hooked when the NAV MODE switch is set from OFF to GND ALIGN again. Be aware that whatever has been hooked (OWN AC or HB) will provide the data that is entered when NAV MODE is set from OFF to GND ALIGN.</p>
<p>For a reference alignment, alignment has to reach fine align complete. Both CVA ALIGN and GND ALIGN can be used to establish a reference alignment. The reference alignment is complete when a dot appears in the diamond.</p>
<p>To establish a reference alignment follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>WCS switch - STBY.</li>
<li>NAV MODE - CVA or GND.</li>
<li>DATA LINK - ON (CV ops only).</li>
<li>D/L MODE - CAINS/WAYPT (CV ops only).</li>
<li>Reference alignment continues to fine align complete.</li>
<li>NAV MODE switch to INS.</li>
<li>WCS - OFF.</li>
<li>NAV MODE - OFF.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unstable current or temporary loss of power will cause the CAINS to be deselected and will be indicated by a flashing HS acronym. A reference alignment cannot be done through a handset alignment, even if continued to fine align complete. For a successful reference alignment the aircraft must not move and the parking brake must not be cycled after the reference heading has been stored. For a valid reference alignment, it isn’t necessary to switch NAV MODE to INS, instead it can be switched directly to OFF from either CVA or GND ALIGN.</p>
<h4 id="catapult-alignment"><a class="header" href="#catapult-alignment">Catapult Alignment</a></h4>
<p>The CAT ALIGN mode is used to prevent suspend align when positioned on the catapult and the parking brake has been released. The purpose of the catapult align mode is to provide normal CVA ALIGN as long as possible. When CAT ALIGN is selected, large roll, pitch, speed, and heading changes of the ship can cause the program to automatically switch to INS.</p>
<h3 id="navigation-fix-update"><a class="header" href="#navigation-fix-update">Navigation Fix Update</a></h3>
<p>An error of latitude or longitude in the computer position of the aircraft can be corrected by a navigation fix update. Updating is especially important in the backup modes (AHRS AM and IMU/ AM) because of the estimated winds and magnetic variation changes. A nav fix is done via a ground-reference-point (latitude and longitude) position. The range and bearing of this position to the present aircraft position is used to update or correct existing values. The nav system may be updated by either a radar fix, a TACAN fix, or a visual fix.</p>
<p>Before performing a nav fix, the latitude and longitude of the desired update point (radar, TACAN, or visual) must be stored in one of eight navigation point locations (three WPs, FIX PT, HOME BASE, HOST AREA, DEF PT, and IP). This data can be stored prior to flight by data link or by manual insertion. Then follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook the Waypoint you choose to select for the nav fix.</li>
<li>Check the stored latitude and longitude on the TID.</li>
<li>Rotate the CATEGORY switch to NAV and select the desired type of update.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that updating the position while in INS, and to a lesser degree while in IMU, can introduce a greater navigational position error than already present, in particular if a radar fix is used to update the nav system. Updates with a visual or TACAN fix provide reasonable accuracy (assuming a good MAG VAR during TACAN updates). Updating your nav system via a nav fix should be primarily used in the AHRS mode.</p>
<h4 id="radar-update"><a class="header" href="#radar-update">Radar Update</a></h4>
<p>A RDR FIX may be selected before or after positioning the DDD cursors. If the RDR FIX button is depressed, the computer computes the present position of the aircraft by measuring the range and bearing from the selected point. The delta between the computer position and the position determined by the INS is then displayed on the TID. If entry of this delta into the navigation computations is desired, press the FIX ENABLE button. If the delta does not appear to be correct, the computer and the readout can be cleared by pressing the RDR FIX button. The fix may then be attempted again. The RIO should also perform periodic checks of own aircraft system altitude and update the altitude if necessary.</p>
<p>Radar updating is performed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>TID CURSOR/CAP - Hook Desired Navigation Point for Update.</li>
<li>PULSE SRCH button - Depress.</li>
<li>On sensor control panel: STAB switch - IN. EL BARS switch - 1. AZ SCAN switch - As Desired.</li>
<li>RDR FIX button - Depress.</li>
<li>DDD CURSOR button - Depress.</li>
<li>Action switch - Half Action (first detent).</li>
<li>Cursor is displayed on DDD.</li>
<li>Manipulate hand control DDD cursor over desired ground map point.</li>
<li>Action switch - Full Action and Release. (This will cause the DDD cursor to remain at the selected position.</li>
<li>Observe the delta for LAT and LONG on TID.</li>
<li>If readouts are unsatisfactory, deselect RDR FIX and repeat steps 4 through 12.</li>
<li>FIX ENABLE button - Depress.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To clear the previous hooked DDD cursor position, go to half action and then release prior to initiating full action for the new position hook.</p>
<h4 id="tacan-update"><a class="header" href="#tacan-update">TACAN Update</a></h4>
<p>To perform a nav fix by TACAN, it requires that a prestored waypoint shares identical LAT and LONG values with the TACAN station that will be used for the fix. Select the TACAN channel for the desired station and verify by listening to the coded identifier tone in the headset.</p>
<p>Press the TACAN FIX button to update the aircraft position from a TACAN station. The WCS computer then calculates the own aircraft position error based on the range and bearing from the TACAN station. The delta is then entered in the same manner as with a radar fix.</p>
<p>Perform a TACAN fix following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a TACAN channel whose latitude and longitude correspond to an update point.</li>
<li>Hook the desired update point (WAYPT 1, FIX PT, HOME BASE, etc.).</li>
<li>CATEGORY switch - NAV.</li>
<li>TACAN FIX button - Depress.</li>
<li>Observe the present position delta readout.</li>
<li>If delta is unsatisfactory, deselect TACAN FIX and repeat steps 2 through 7.</li>
<li>FIX ENABLE button - Depress.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During a TACAN FIX, the MAG VAR must be the same as the TACAN station magnetic variation, or the update will be in error. Given a TACAN station with a range of 100 NM from ownship, a 1°MAG VAR error introduces a 1.74nm error into the ownship’s TACAN update.</p>
<h4 id="visual-update"><a class="header" href="#visual-update">Visual Update</a></h4>
<p>To perform a visual fix, fly over a prestored waypoint and press the VIS FIX button. Estimate your timing, because the aircraft nose and fuselage can obscure the fix point during overflight. It is also difficult to estimate when directly overhead a waypoint if the aircraft altitude is greater than 10,000 feet. The delta for the visual fix is displayed on the TID. Enter the delta by pressing FIX ENABLE.</p>
<p>To perform a visual fix use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook the desired update point (WAY PT, HB, IP, etc.).</li>
<li>Select NAV category on CAP.</li>
<li>Overfly the selected prestored point and when over the point, depress the VIS FIX button on the cap.</li>
<li>If the delta is not satisfactory, press VIS FIX again to clear the delta and repeat from step 1.</li>
<li>If a satisfactory delta is displayed, depress the FIX ENABLE button; this causes the delta correction of own-aircraft position to be inserted into the computer.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="data-link-update"><a class="header" href="#data-link-update">Data Link Update</a></h4>
<p>To perform a data link update of the aircraft INS to the TDS frame of reference, the aircraft and TDS must share a prebriefed waypoint, identical in latitude and longitude. Enter this LAT/LONG data into the HOST AREA pseudo target file. The TDS will uplink the common reference point as a data link waypoint. When the aircraft and TDS INS systems agree, the data link waypoint and host area symbols will be superimposed on the TID. If they drift apart, the two pseudo targets on the TID will drift as well.</p>
<p>To perform an update via data link, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook the data link waypoint corresponding prebriefed reference point.</li>
<li>Select the NAV category on CAP.</li>
<li>Overfly the hooked data link waypoint. When immediately over the point, press VIS FIX button on CAP.</li>
<li>Observe delta LAT and LONG on TID.</li>
<li>If deltas are satisfactory and update is desired, depress FIX ENABLE.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a data link update, HOST AREA and data link waypoint should be superimposed on the TID again.</p>
<h4 id="fighter-to-fighter-navigation-update"><a class="header" href="#fighter-to-fighter-navigation-update">Fighter-to-Fighter Navigation Update</a></h4>
<p>Net aircraft that use fighter-to-fighter data link can update their navigation system in the FF/DL mode. To update LAT/LONG hook the net aircraft symbol of an aircraft that is in close proximity and select F/F NAV UPDATE on the CAP. This will enter the hooked aircraft’s coordinates into the INS as own-aircraft coordinates. To update the nav system on an aircraft that is not close, first obtain a radar STT on that aircraft, hook the STT-ed aircraft on the TID and then press F/F NAV UPDATE on the CAP.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> By updating to the selected aircraft’s INS, its calibration/drift can potentially introduce a larger error into your own INS. Both aircraft will share the same error though.</p>
<h3 id="position-marking"><a class="header" href="#position-marking">Position Marking</a></h3>
<p>To mark the position of a pulse radar target, a visual target, or a TACAN station to be displayed on the TID, use the SURF TGT position in the TAC DATA category. Once displayed on the TID, latitude, longitude, range, bearing, and steering data are available, using the CAP or the navigation destination control or both.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not use the position SURF TGT to update the navigation computer. The surface target position symbol is repositioned with respect to own aircraft instead of own aircraft being updated in reference to the surface target.</p>
<p>To mark a pulse radar target on the TID, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the SURF TGT button.</li>
<li>Establish the location via a radar fix.</li>
<li>Select the DDD CURSOR and use the pulse system for radar mapping.</li>
<li>Designate the point of interest by placing the cursor over that point.</li>
<li>Selecting full action.</li>
<li>Select RDR FIX.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will display a delta from the hooked point to the surface target. Ignore the delta and select FIX ENABLE to position the surface target over the previously identified radar position. A very accurate readout of latitude, longitude, and steering information will become available for the Surface Target Waypoint.</p>
<p>The method for visual targets is the same, but a visual fix is required. You can also mark a TACAN station by using the same method and following the TACAN fix procedures. After completing any of the above procedures, the SURF TGT symbol will be displayed on the TID at the computed latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>
<p>The surface target symbol can also be used as a destination point. If its position has been previously entered, the symbol will appear on the TID. One method for special position marking is to hook any point on the TID and select SURF TGT. The surface target symbol now appears over the hooked point and its new position will be stored in the WCS computer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="attitude-and-heading-reference-set-ahrs"><a class="header" href="#attitude-and-heading-reference-set-ahrs">Attitude and Heading Reference Set (AHRS)</a></h1>
<p>The AHRS provides backup pitch and roll information to the CSDC and WCS computer, if attitude data from the INS is not available. At any time, the AHRS provides prime magnetic heading to the BDHI for direct analog display and to the CSDC where it is converted to digital information for the VDIG, MDIG, and the WCS. Additionally, the autopilot gets its heading reference from the AHRS.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The only analog cockpit display for magnetic heading is the BDHI. The HUD, VDI, TID, HSD, and multiple display indicator are digital and receive their inputs from the AHRS through the CSDC. Thus. in case of a CSDC failure, the only magnetic heading is displayed on the BDHI.</p>
<p>The main assemblies of the AHRS are a two-gyro platform (vertical and directional displacement gyros), an electronic control amplifier, a compass controller, a magnetic azimuth detector, and an electronic compensator.</p>
<p>In case of an IMU failure, the CSDC automatically selects AHRS attitude information for display and autopilot control. The directional gyro smoothens the flux valve heading signal in the SLAVED mode or provides a direct heading reference in the DG mode. The resulting heading is transmitted to the BDHI, the CSDC, and the WCS.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the INS nav mode IMU true heading is used and must be converted to magnetic heading by adding or subtracting the magnetic variation to have a backup magnetic value, if needed. Under normal operation, AHRS magnetic heading is used for all displays.</p>
<p>The AHRS is unlimited in roll but limited to 82° in pitch. If the pitch attitude exceeds ±82, it will precess. A gradual precession in roll, pitch, and heading can also be expected in sustained turns at slow rates (less than 6° per minute). Large roll and pitch precession errors can be corrected by flying straight and level, without accelerating, and pressing and holding the HDG set button on the compass controller panel. Pressing and holding this button corrects precession errors at a rate of 12° per minute minimum. The HDG set button should be held for at least 3 minutes. Before repeating the 3-minute cycle, it should be released for at least 1 minute.</p>
<h2 id="compass-controller-panel"><a class="header" href="#compass-controller-panel">Compass Controller Panel</a></h2>
<p>Use the compass controller panel to select one of three compass modes when the AHRS is used as a heading reference. For a description, see Compass Control Panel.</p>
<p>When magnetic heading references are unreliable, operate the system in the DG mode. When the magnetic reference is reliable, operate the system in the SLAVED mode. When DG or SLAVED modes are inoperable, the COMP mode can be used for emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If both the IMU and the AHRS fail, pitch and roll attitude indications from the HUD, TID, and DDD will be removed, and the IMU and AHRS advisory lights illuminate. Select COMP mode on the compass controller panel to possibly restore valid magnetic heading information to the HUD, VDI, and HSD, the AHRS advisory lights will go off. Disregard the invalid pitch and roll attitude information that will be restored to the HUD and VDI.</p>
<h2 id="ahrs-operation"><a class="header" href="#ahrs-operation">AHRS Operation</a></h2>
<p>As a compass, the AHRS operates in three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The directional gyro (DG) mode provides a free-gyro heading reference with Earthrate correction.</li>
<li>The SLAVED mode provides a gyrostabilized magnetic heading</li>
<li>And the compass (COMP) mode provides an emergency magnetic heading from the compass transmitter only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the COMP mode is selected, the AFCS is automatically disengaged to prevent erratic steering commands. The COMP mode cannot provide a sufficiently stable heading signal for AFCS operation and should only be used for emergencies. To erect the AHRS, press and hold the HDG set button on the compass controller (3 minutes on, 1 minute off cycle) until the needle of the synchronous indicator is bracketing the null mark.</p>
<p>If nav mode is set to INS or IMU/AM, attitude displays will continue to indicate properly when the AHRS pitch limit of 82° is exceeded, but all displays of magnetic heading will be in error and the advisory lights may be on or off. If this is encountered, accurate and stable magnetic heading displays on the HUD, VDI, HSD, TID, and multiple display indicator can be regained immediately by inserting the proper MAG VAR via the computer address panel.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tacan-system-anarn-84"><a class="header" href="#tacan-system-anarn-84">TACAN System (AN/ARN-84)</a></h1>
<p>The TACAN system indicates a slant range accurate to within 0.1 NM and a bearing of 0.5° to any surface station selected. Slant range to airborne stations is provided with an air-to-air (A/A) mode. The operating range is approximately 300 NM, if line of sight is given.</p>
<p>The system offers 126 operating channels in each of 2 modes. Receiving frequencies for surface-to-air operation are 962 to 1024 MHz and 1151 to 1213 MHz, for air-to-air operations, the frequencies are from 1025 to 1150 MHz. The TACAN uses two antennas that automatically switch in a 6-second interval until a threshold signal is received. Note that the TACAN can take up to 2 minutes to warm up when turned on for the first time after a cold start.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-modes"><a class="header" href="#tacan-modes">TACAN Modes</a></h2>
<p>The system is capable of receiving valid signals from a ground station simultaneously with 99 other aircraft in either REC or T/R mode.</p>
<p>In the A/A mode, the system is capable of transponding with each of five cooperating aircraft, indicating slant range information to each, but the system will interrogate and lock on to only one at a time.</p>
<p>Both pilot and RIO share Identical TACAN control panels on the left consoles. Individual TACAN CMD buttons on both the pilot and RIO left consoles provide transfer of TACAN control between pilot and RIO. Control of TACAN is indicated by a flip-flop indicator in each cockpit showing PLT (pilot) or RIO. Either crewman may adjust the audio level of the identification signal. For TACAN panel description see TACAN Control Panel.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-displays"><a class="header" href="#tacan-displays">TACAN Displays</a></h2>
<p>Bearing and distance to a TACAN station are displayed on the BDHI, the HSD, and the multiple display indicator. Deviation to the TACAN station is displayed on the HUD and VDI (VDIG) and the HSD and multiple display indicator.</p>
<p>The MDIG displays TACAN bearing marker, deviation ticks, range-to-TACAN station, and course. The HUD and VDI display provide a TACAN deviation bar, which is coded, on the HUD: solid line - TO station, dashed line - FROM station and on the VDI: bright bar - TO station, dark bar - FROM station.</p>
<p>TACAN information is also displayed on both the pilot’s and RIO’s identical BDHI. The bearing and distance functions of the BDHI come alive when the TACAN mode select switch is set to T/R. In the REC and T/R modes, magnetic bearings are displayed by the No.2 (large) needle, which unlocks and enters a search mode (spins) whenever bearing information is unreliable.</p>
<p>Range information received in T/R or A/A mode is displayed in nautical miles on the distance counter. An OFF flag covers the counter window if the range information is unreliable or not available. TACAN information is also displayed on the pilot HSD, HUD, and VDI and on the RIO multiple display indicator in other navigation modes.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-operation"><a class="header" href="#tacan-operation">TACAN Operation</a></h2>
<p>If after approximately 2 minutes warm up time the range and bearing indications continue to search when a reliable station is selected, check circuit breakers should or select another station. The system has a memory feature so that tracking will not be interrupted by momentary disruption of received signals.</p>
<p>A range signal that is lost and has been previously tracked for at least 10 seconds, will be sustained by memory for 9 to 12 seconds. A bearing signal that has been tracked for at least 15 seconds will be retained for 3 to 8 seconds after signal loss. This allows for automatic antenna switching without a loss of TACAN displays.</p>
<p>During the minimum warmup time, failure indications and erroneous readouts should be disregarded and self-test results may be inconclusive.</p>
<h2 id="tacan-bit"><a class="header" href="#tacan-bit">TACAN BIT</a></h2>
<p>The TACAN system has a built-in test that continuously monitors the TACAN functionality and provides an interruptive self-test. To start a 22-second interruptive self-test, use the momentary button (BIT switch) and monitor the GO (green) and NO-GO (amber) status lights.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A BIT performed on TACAN stations within 2 NM can give an invalid indication. If a TCN acronym or NO-GO response is observed while tuned to a local station, along with normal TACAN azimuth and range, the acronym and/or the NO-GO should be disregarded.</p>
<p>The normal BIT sequence is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set MODE switch to T/R, allow 2 minutes for warmup.</li>
<li>Press and hold BIT button.</li>
<li>Both GO and NO-GO lights illuminate (light test).</li>
<li>BDHI range OFF flag appears.</li>
<li>BDHI bearing needle rotates counterclockwise.</li>
<li>Release button; both lights go out (self-test starts).</li>
<li>After 5 to 6 seconds, BDHI and HSD range reads 2 NM, BDHI and HSD bearing reads 4° (identify TACAN station).</li>
<li>After 22 seconds, if good, green GO light illuminates, if bad, amber NO-GO light illuminates.</li>

<p>A BDHI is on the right side of the pilot and RIO instrument panels, see Bearing Distance Heading Indicator (BDHI). It displays aircraft magnetic heading with navigation bearing data and range information. The controls on the compass panel set the BDHI compass card to operate in a slaved or nonslaved (FREE DG) compass mode. A fixed index marker at the 12-o’clock position indicates the magnetic heading.</p>
<p>Two servo-driven bearing needles show magnetic bearings to the selected UHF (ADF) and TACAN stations. The No.1 (single bar) needle receives signals from the UHF (ADF) system, the No.2 (double bar) needle receives signals from the TACAN coupler.</p>
<p>The No.1 needle will continue to point toward the signal source, even if the compass card is misaligned or a malfunction exists, but the bearing to the station is displayed on the indicator as a relative bearing and the top of the indicator bezel will show 000°. The No.2 needle will also continue to show the magnetic bearing to the selected station or may revert to the search mode.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/ext_vor_ils_beacon.jpg" alt="ext_vor_ils_beacon" /></p>
<p>The VHF omnidirectional range instrument landing system, or VOR/ILS, provides
precise bearing and course deviation information from a transmitting ground
station. Additionally, the aircraft is able to use precision landing approach
and descent capabilities at localizer equipped fields. Guidance information from
the VOR/ILS system is provided to the pilot on the BDHI, ADI, and HSI. VOR/ILS
function is enabled on these displays using the appropriate Flight Director
Group control selections on the Bearing/Distance Selector switch, the Navigation
Mode Selector switch, and the Flight Director Switch.</p>
<h2 id="ils-system"><a class="header" href="#ils-system">ILS System</a></h2>
<p>The ILS system is designed to detect deviations from the designated landing approach path
and relay this information to selected avionics in the aircraft.</p>
<p>When the appropriate ILS mode
is selected on the Navigation Function Selector Panel, several instruments provide guidance
for precision approach. These include the Deviation Indicator on the Horizontal Situation
Indicator (HSI), which shows lateral alignment with the runway, and the Glide-slope Indicator
on the ADI, which displays the vertical descent angle relative to the ideal glide path.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the Flight Director is activated, steering cues will be provided by the
needles on the Attitude Director Indicator (ADI), offering visual guidance for both pitch
and roll to maintain the correct approach path.</p>
<p>In the rear cockpit the both horizontal and
vertical deviations are presented on the Course Indicator.</p>
<p>The typical maximum deviations are ±2.5 degrees for the localizer and ±0.7 degrees
for the glide-slope.</p>
<h3 id="marker-beacons"><a class="header" href="#marker-beacons">Marker Beacons</a></h3>
<p>If Marker Beacons are positioned along the approach path, the aircraft's system will audibly
signal and illuminate the corresponding Marker Beacon light as it passes over each one.
Depending on the specific setup at an airport, there can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outer Marker: Identified by a low-pitched, continuous tone.</li>
<li>Middle Marker: Recognized by a higher-pitched, alternating audio tone. This marker indicates
a closer proximity to the runway, usually at the decision altitude for landing.</li>
<li>Inner Marker: Characterized by a very high-pitched tone or a series of high-pitched dots.
This marker is not always present but, when it is, signifies an even closer position to the
runway end.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vorils-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#vorils-control-panel">VOR/ILS Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/pilot_vor_ils_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_vor_ils_panel" /></p>
<p>The control panel for the VOR/ILS is found on the front cockpit left console;
the panel includes a frequency indicator, two frequency select knobs (<num>2</num>), a volume
control (marked NAV VOL) (<num>1</num>), a marker beacon volume control knob (MB VOL)
(<num>3</num>), and a
VOL/MRK TEST pushbutton (<num>4</num>).</p>
<h3 id="vorils-frequency-selector-knobs"><a class="header" href="#vorils-frequency-selector-knobs">VOR/ILS Frequency Selector Knobs</a></h3>
<p>The Frequency Selector Knob (<num>2</num>) is a dual actuation concentric knob; the outer ring
selects the number to the left of the decimal point on the frequency indicator,
whereas the inner knob selects numbers to the right.</p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/dcs_map_vor_ils.jpg" alt="dcs_map_vor_ils" /></p>
<p>In DCS, to find the desired VOR/ILS frequency of your target, go on the Map and
click an airfield that you want to fly to. If available,
VOR and ILS frequencies will be listed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Not every airfield has a VOR station or an ILS systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system is designed to automatically detect whether a tuned frequency corresponds
to a VOR station or an ILS localizer. VOR operates within a frequency range of 108 MHz
to 117.95 MHz. The ILS localizer frequency range is from 108.1 MHz to 111.95 MHz.</p>
<p>In the shared frequency region, VOR stations typically operate on frequencies with
an even-numbered tenth of the range (e.g. 108.2 MHz, 108.4 MHz, etc.), while ILS localizer
frequencies are assigned to the odd-numbered tenths, including hundredths of a MHz
(e.g. 108.1 MHz, 108.3 MHz, 108.35 MHz, etc.).</p>
<p>The glide-slope component of the ILS operates in a frequency range from 329.3 MHz to 335.0 MHz.
These frequencies are paired with their corresponding localizer frequencies, ensuring
that there is no need for separate manual setting. When a localizer frequency is selected,
the associated glide-slope frequency is automatically tuned, providing integrated lateral
and vertical guidance (if available) for precision approaches.
The Marker Beacon that works in conjunction with the ILS system, operates at a frequency
of 75 MHz.</p>

on the HSI to move to center (with a maximum allowable error of ±4°) ,the "to-from" indicator on
the HSI to indicate TO, the marker beacon lights to come on and the bearing pointers on both the HSI
and BDHI to swing to 315°.</p>

<p>The NAV VOL knob (<num>1</num>) both activates the VOR/ILS system, as well as controls the
audible volume for the front cockpit. The knob is turned clockwise to power the
system on, then further to increase the volume. The MB VOL knob (<num>3</num>) adjusts the

<p>In the rear cockpit is the Course Indicator, on the main instrument panel; During
an ILS approach, the indicator displays relative heading for the course set in the
course selector window, as well as horizontal and vertical position relative to
the ILS localizer and glide slope entered by the pilot. In this way, the WSO can
assist the pilot in achieving and maintaining glide slope. The controls for the
indicator are purely for the WSOs reference, and do not interact with the Flight
Director Group displays in the front cockpit.</p>
<p>Components of the course indicator are a TO-FROM indicator (does not function
with ILS), a course deviation scale, a glide slope deviation scale, a COURSE
selector window, a course SET knob, a heading pointer and heading scale, a
marker beacon light, a GLIDE SLOPE indicator, a course deviation indicator (LOC
OR RANGE), and course and glide slope OFF warning flags.</p>
<p>Once the pilot has selected an ILS frequency, the WSO must set a course inbound

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ics---intercommunications-system"><a class="header" href="#ics---intercommunications-system">ICS - Intercommunications System</a></h1>
<p>The ICS provides normal, backup, or emergency communications between crewmembers. It also combines and amplifies audio signals received from other electronic receiving equipment (ECM, Sidewinder tone, IFF/SIF, radar altimeter, and voice radios, etc.). Identical ICS control panels are on the pilot and RIO left side consoles. The ICS consists of four amplifiers, two at each cockpit station, which permit duplex operation during normal operation. If one amplifier fails, it may be bypassed by selecting either the B/U (backup) or EMER (emergency) position on the ICS control panel. This permits continued ICS operation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If two amplifiers fail at the same station, intercommunication is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> By selecting EMER on the respective ICS control panel and using the other crewmember’s amplifier, you can listen in on audio normally only available at that station (like SW-tone or ALQ-126 PRF) but you lose the ability to control the volume of the audio you listen to.</p>
<p>The external interphone connection is in the nose-wheel well. When the pilot ICS switch is set to HOT MIC, ground personnel can communicate with the cockpit stations. In DCS, this works through selecting the ground crew communication menu in the DCS radio communication menu when activating ICS PTT.</p>

<h3 id="antennas"><a class="header" href="#antennas">Antennas</a></h3>
<p>Four VHF/UHF/L-band dual-blade antennas provide omnidirectional coverage for VHF/UHF voice, UHF data link, TACAN, and identification friend or foe/selective identification feature transponder (APX-72) operation. TACAN and VHF/UHF 2 voice communications use one set of antennas; UHF 1 voice communications, the data link, and IFF transponder use another set of antennas. Refer to the general arrangement illustration for antenna locations. The IFF interrogator (APX-76) antenna is an integral part of the AWG-9 WCS antenna.</p>
<p>Each individual system is connected to the appropriate portion of an upper or lower antenna through a coaxial switch and diplexer. The V/UHF 2 ANT switch on the RIO communication TACAN CMD panel must be used to select the upper or lower antenna manually; there is no automatic actuation function in these aircraft. The data link (DIL) antennas are similarly selected manually. Upper or lower antenna is selected by means of ANTENNA switches on the DATA LINK control panel. The UHF 1 voice communication ARC-159 antenna is shared with the DIL antenna system and is always on the opposite antenna from the one selected by the ANTENNA switch.</p>
<p>The upper V/UHF 2/TACAN antenna is the first one aft of the canopy on the turtleback, and the lower antenna is embedded in the bottom of the left ventral fin. Only one antenna is used at a time. Automatic switching between antennas prevents the loss of TACAN information. If a signal is lost or is too weak to hold receiver lockup, the TACAN automatically cycles between the two antennas every 6 seconds seeking a stronger signal.</p>
<p>During this cycling and search period, memory circuits retain range tracking for 8 to 12 seconds and bearing tracking for 8 seconds. The IFF antenna lobing switch is controlled by the IFF ANT switch on the RIO right outboard console. In AUTO, the lobing switch cycles the receiver-transmitter between the upper and lower antenna. In the LWR (lower) position, only the lower antenna is used to receive and transmit signals. The upper antenna pattern has a slight forward tilt; the lower pattern a slight aft tilt.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In real life, it is often necessary to select LWR to improve ground station reception. However, due to the limitations of DCS, antenna switching is not modeled and thus not functional. The use of antennas is automated and/or neglected for the player. All radios and radio functions work through proper keying.</p>
<h3 id="audio-warning-signals"><a class="header" href="#audio-warning-signals">Audio Warning Signals</a></h3>
<p>Audio warning signals from the weapon system are available to either or both crewmen through the ICS. Each signal has a distinct tone. A visual display accompanies most audio signals so that the flight crew can expect the tone and interpret its meaning. Most audio signals may be attenuated or turned off if not required, allowing the flight crew to concentrate on more critical tones.</p>
<p>Critical warning tones cannot be attenuated by any mode of ICS operation. The table below provides a glossary of audio warning signals available within the aircraft weapon systems. Approximately 1 minute of warmup is required to achieve normal operating temperature.</p>

<p>The F-14 Tomcat is equipped with the Link 4 data link system to allow for the transmission and reception of target track, waypoint information, and steering commands. Link 4 exists in two versions, the first being Link 4A which allows a surface ship or airborne AWACS to control the aircraft and also Link 4C, unique to the F-14, which is a fighter-to-fighter data link.</p>
<p>The Link 4A or TADIL C data link allows the F-14 to connect to a data link network controlled by a surface ship or an AWACS. The data source (or really its operator) will then provide the F-14 with target tracks, waypoints, and control commands. Additionally, it’s also used for the carrier automatic landing system (ACLS).</p>
<p>Link 4C, on the other hand, allows up to four F-14 Tomcats to interconnect and share target tracks to coordinate their engagements.</p>
<p>The system does not allow an F-14 to use both at the same time as the same transmitter and receiver are used for both A and C links. The Link 4 system itself, operates using the UHF radio band at 5,000 bits per second.</p>
<p>The Link 4 is controlled using the Data Link Control Panel and the Data Link Reply and Antenna Control Panel. Received control signals are displayed on the pilot VDI indicators (Vertical Display Indicator (VDI)) and the RIO DDI panel (Digital Data Indicator (DDI)).</p>
<h2 id="link-4-controls"><a class="header" href="#link-4-controls">Link 4 Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/datalink1.png" alt="Data Link Control Panel" />
The Data Link Control Panel contains the main Link 4 system power switches and the frequency selection wheels.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first switch controls the Link 4 built-in test and also enables the anti-jam (A-J) function, this control is currently non-functional in DCS and should be set to NORMAL.</li>
<li>The frequency thumbwheels are used to set the used data link frequency, note that the first digit is set and displayed as a fixed number before the first wheel. The allowable frequency range is 300.0 MHz to 324.9 MHz.</li>
<li>The third switch controls power and operational mode of the Link 4. ON turns on and enables the Link 4A data link, OFF disables the system and AUX enables the Link 4C data link.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/datalinkantenna1.png" alt="Data Link Reply and Antenna Control Panel" />
The Data Link Reply and Antenna Control Panel is used to select what antenna to use, own aircraft data link address, whether to transmit and which mode the Link 4A is used in.</p>
<ol>
<li>The ANTENNA switch sets if the data link uses the upper or lower antenna. As these are the same antennas that the UHF 1 (AN/ARC-159) uses it automatically sets that radio to the other antenna.</li>
<li>The REPLY switch sets whether own aircraft replies to data link messages. NORM allows for normal operation while CANC turns off the transmitter and sets the data link to receive only.</li>
<li>The MODE switch controls whether the Link 4A operates in the normal TAC (Tactical) mode or the CAINS/WAYPT (Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigation System/Waypoint) mode. The TAC mode is the normal airborne mode while the CAINS/WAYPT mode is used while on the carrier deck to receive preflight waypoints and INS alignment data from the ship's INS system. The switch is solenoid held and spring-loaded to the TAC position, if the data link reception is lost or the power lost the switch automatically returns to the TAC mode, forcing an ongoing INS alignment to the backup handset mode. If the aircraft takes off with the switch in the CAINS/WAYPT position the weight on wheels sensor will also release it to TAC.</li>
<li>The two address thumbwheel sets the least significant bits (two lowest numbers) of the aircraft data link address, the rest have to be set by the ground crew.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="link-4-in-dcs"><a class="header" href="#link-4-in-dcs">Link 4 in DCS</a></h2>
<p>The Link 4 implementation in the Heatblur DCS F-14 implements both the Link 4A and C versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>To use Link 4A the data link has to be powered on, set to Link 4A mode (ON) and tuned to the correct data link frequency for the desired host which can be found on the kneeboard. On the ground and set to the CAINS/WAYPT mode the data link will receive the ME set waypoints and allow for CVA alignment if on a carrier. The frequency does not need to be set to use CAINS/WAYPT as that frequency is set with jumpers on the actual equipment by the ground crew.</li>
<li>When set to TAC the data link will then receive the 8 target tracks with the highest priority from the TDS controller. The Link 4A also allows for automatic carrier landings with the data link set to use the carrier as a host.</li>
<li>To use Link 4C the data link should be set to Link 4C (AUX) and be tuned to a frequency agreed upon between participating aircraft. Up to four aircraft can participate within a flight and all four aircraft should have different addresses set. As the ground crew set the two most significant bits to be the same for a flight automatically the link can only be used within the same flight currently.</li>
<li>In Link 4C the participating aircraft shares up to 4 target tracks, selected by the RIO using the CAP as well as own aircraft position. The CAP also allows the RIO to update own aircraft INS position to another aircraft on the link to correlate track transmissions.</li>

<h2 id="anapx-76-iff-interrogator"><a class="header" href="#anapx-76-iff-interrogator">AN/APX-76 IFF Interrogator</a></h2>
<p>The AN/APX-76 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) interrogator is integrated into the AN/AWG-9 operation. Then interrogator antenna itself is located on the AN/AWG-9 antenna gimbal platform.</p>
<p>An IFF system works by sending out an interrogation pulse and then listening for returns from cooperating transponders. In addition to the unencrypted civilian mode the AN/APX-76 is capable of interrogating in the encrypted military mode 4. This ensures that targets replying to mode 4 interrogations are indeed friendly.</p>
<p>The AN/APX-76 can be used both in search radar modes and in STT radar modes. To enable interrogation the IFF switch is depressed on the Detail Data Display Panel which then activates the interrogator for as long as the button is held up to 10 seconds max.</p>
<p>When enabled IFF received IFF returns are then overlaid on the normal AN/AWG-9 radar returns on the DDD. A friendly target will be indicated with two bars, one above and one below the normal radar return. As the AN/APX-76 is a secondary mode radar (transponder radar) apart from the AWG-9 the IFF can sometimes also detect targets not detected by the AWG-9. In this case the IFF return will not have a radar echo inside it.</p>
<p>In the search mode this is overlaid over each target replying and in STT over the STT target. Additionally, if the STT target is hooked on the TID the DDD will switch from normal range display to a ±10 NM display to enable display of multiple returns in case of closely grouped targets.</p>

</div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="hydraulic-system"><a class="header" href="#hydraulic-system">Hydraulic System</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 has two separate hydraulic systems, the flight hydraulic system and the combined hydraulic system.</p>
<p>Both systems are driven by hydraulic pumps connected to each engine, the flight hydraulic system from the right engine and the combined hydraulic system from the left engine. Both systems are pressurized to around 3,000 psi when operating normally.</p>
<p>Flight control surfaces are supplied by both systems while the combined system also supplies pressure to secondary systems such as the flaps, landing gear and the refueling probe. This is so that both systems can drive the control surfaces independently from each other in case of a failure in the other.</p>
<p>Additionally, the hydraulic systems related to systems not necessary while airborne can be isolated by a switch next to the landing gear handle. This is so that damage to those systems won’t affect the combined system pressure and cause fluid loss. The systems that can be isolated are the landing gear, wheel brakes, anti-skid and nosewheel steering. This switch is mechanically locked to not isolating these systems by the landing gear handle when it’s in the down position.</p>
<p>If only one of the hydraulic pumps fail it’s possible to pressurize that system from the other pump via the hydraulic transfer pump. This pump is an omni-directional hydraulically driven pump that can supply either system from the other and will maintain a pressure between 2,400 and 2,600 psi if the driving system is at around 3,000 psi. If one system pressure falls below 500 psi the pump will be secured to prevent pump damage and preserve pressure in the working system. The pump can also be manually disengaged by the pilot.</p>
<p>In case of failure of both hydraulic pumps the flight hydraulic system can be driven by an electrical pump, called the emergency flight hydraulic pump. This pump is capable of independently driving the tail control surfaces, enabling the aircraft to return home and land even without pressure in either main hydraulic system. The electric pump is automatically enabled if both main systems drop below 2,100 psi and shut off if either reaches 2,400 psi again. The automatic pump activation activates the system in the low mode but it can also manually be selected to either low or high operation. The control surfaces will have a reduced deflection rate if driven by this pump, more so in low than high.</p>
<p>There is also a hand driven hydraulic pump that can be used to pressurize the refueling probe and wheel brake accumulator if there’s otherwise no pressure in the combined system. This is mainly for unpowered ground operation but can be used as a backup in the air.</p>
<h3 id="controls-and-indicators-1"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-indicators-1">Controls and Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../../img/hydraulic1.png" alt="hydraulic" /></p>
<p>The HYD PRESS, hydraulic pressure indicator, contains two gauges indicating COMB, combined, and FLT, flight system hydraulic pressure in thousands of psi. The scales have markings for the nominal 3,000 psi pressure when the pumps are operating normally.</p>
<p>Below the gauges are flags indicating hydraulic pressure availability to the spoilers SPOIL and the operation of the EMER FLT, emergency flight hydraulic pump. The HI flag indicates on if the emergency flight hydraulic pump is operating in high and the LOW if it’s operating in low.</p>
<p><img src="systems/../../img/brakepressure1.png" alt="brakepressure" /></p>
<p>The BRAKE PRESSURE gauge shows available pressure in the brake accumulators. PARK indicating parking brake pressure and the AUX indicating wheel brake pressure. The green area represents a pressure from about 2,150 psi to 3,000 psi and the red a pressure below that.</p>
<p><img src="systems/../../img/hydraulictransferpump1.png" alt="hydraulictransferpump" /></p>
<p>The HYD TRANSFER PUMP, hydraulic transfer pump switch is located on its own panel on the pilot’s right side console. The switch allows for manual shut-off of the pump (SHUTOFF) but is normally in the NORMAL position allowing the pump to activate automatically if either hydraulic pump fails. The switch is guarded to the NORMAL position.</p>
<p>The emergency flight hydraulic pump is controlled by a guarded switch on the Master Test Panel. The guarded position, (AUTO)LOW allows the pump to automatically activate as detailed above and the two other positions, HIGH and LOW can manually activate those modes when the guard is up.</p>
<p>On the Caution - Advisory Indicator the only relevant caution light is the HYD PRESS light indicating that either main hydraulic system pressure is below 2,100 psi. It turns off when both systems are again above 2,400 psi.</p>

<h2 id="oxygen-system"><a class="header" href="#oxygen-system">Oxygen System</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 carries one or two 10-liter liquid oxygen bottles providing oxygen to the crew when needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> The oxygen supply is controlled on the pilot Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control Panel and RIO Oxygen-Vent Airflow Control Panel respectively. Both panels contain an OXYGEN switch that sets oxygen supply to ON or OFF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indicator:</strong> Liquid oxygen remaining is shown on the Liquid Oxygen Quantity Indicator on the pilot’s right side console. The gauge shows remaining liters of liquid oxygen up to 20 liters (if two bottles are installed). The indicator is electrically driven, and if it receives no power, an OFF flag will be visible, and it will display 0 liters remaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caution light:</strong> The RIO Caution-Advisory Panel has the OXY LOW caution light which illuminates when the liquid oxygen quantity is below 2 liters.</p>
<p>During the INST test on the ref:MTPanel, the liquid oxygen meter shows 2 liters, and the OXY LOW caution light illuminates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="canopy"><a class="header" href="#canopy">Canopy</a></h2>
<p>The rear-hinged F-14 canopy is operated hydraulically and pneumatically. Controls are present in both the pilot and RIO cockpits.</p>
<p>See Canopy Control Handle or Canopy Control Handle for the controls.</p>
<p>The CANOPY caution light on both the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator and the RIO Caution-Advisory Panel illuminates if the canopy is not in the down and locked, secured position.</p>
<h2 id="ejection-system"><a class="header" href="#ejection-system">Ejection System</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat is equipped with dual Martin-Baker GRU-7A rocket-assisted ejection seats, one for the pilot and one for the RIO. The ejection system is a zero/zero system, capable of successfully ejecting the crewmembers at zero airspeed, stationary, on the ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ejection command lever:</strong> This lever, located in the RIO cockpit, selects if the RIO ejects the pilot as well when he ejects. The lever is situated beside the sensor control panel, see Eject Command Lever. When set to PILOT, the pilot ejects both crewmembers, while the RIO ejects only himself. When set to MCO, both crewmembers eject both crewmembers.</p>
<p>The system does not allow pilot-only ejection because it would be undesirable for the RIO to remain in the aircraft alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indicator:</strong> The pilot has an indication of what position the ejection command lever is at on the Landing Gear Control Panel, the EJECT CMD flip-flop indicator showing PILOT when the lever is in the pilot and MCO when in MCO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canopy jettison:</strong> If the canopy does not jettison when initiating the ejection sequence, it’s possible to manually jettison it using the Canopy Jettison Handle in the pilot cockpit or the Canopy Jettison Handle in the RIO cockpit. If the canopy inhibited ejection after ejection initiation, jettisoning the canopy will most likely restart it. If ejection is needed during a flat spin, it’s also recommended to manually jettison the canopy and allow it to clear before initiating the ejection sequence as the canopy might need longer to clear during a flat spin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jettison-system"><a class="header" href="#jettison-system">Jettison System</a></h2>
<p>The Jettison system has four modes of operation: emergency, ACM, selective, and auxiliary.</p>
<h3 id="emergency-jettison"><a class="header" href="#emergency-jettison">Emergency Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The emergency jettison is selected via the EMERG STORES JETT on the Landing Gear Control Panel. Selection causes the EMERG JETT caution light to illuminate on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement:</strong> The emergency jettison requires only no weight on wheels indicated (no master arm) and ejects all stores except for Sidewinders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acm-jettison"><a class="header" href="#acm-jettison">ACM Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The ACM jettison is selected via the ACM JETT button under the ACM cover/switch on the Air Combat Maneuver Panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement:</strong> The ACM jettison, like the emergency jettison, requires no master arm but instead requires that the landing gear lever is up. Unlike the emergency jettison, the ACM jettison only ejects those stations selected by the RIO on the Armament Panel (set to SEL or B for stations 1 and 8).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selective-jettison"><a class="header" href="#selective-jettison">Selective Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The selective jettison is set and executed by the RIO on the Armament Panel. This mode of jettisoning requires the landing gear handle to be in the up position and the master arm to be on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procedure:</strong> To jettison in selective mode, set the desired station switches to SEL and hold the SEL JETT switch to JETT.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="auxiliary-jettison"><a class="header" href="#auxiliary-jettison">Auxiliary Jettison</a></h3>
<p>The auxiliary jettison mode is a backup mode to use when the other modes have failed. Like the selective jettison mode, it requires the landing gear handle to be up and the master arm to be on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limitation:</strong> This mode can only eject air-to-ground stores and ejects them by actuating the normal release hooks. This means that the aircraft needs to fly straight and level as the stores are not ejected forcefully but instead just released and cleared using gravity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> No jettison mode can jettison ITERs or stores loaded on those; they need to be dropped like normal, with or without the fuzes armed.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electrical-power-system"><a class="header" href="#electrical-power-system">Electrical Power System</a></h1>
<p>All main electrical power in the F-14 is generated from the two engine driven AC generators. The generators connected to the gearboxes on the engines are each capable of generating enough power to individually drive all aircraft systems.</p>
<p>As for DC power generation the F-14 has two transformer-rectifiers supplying 28 V DC, and again each one is individually capable of driving all aircraft DC appliances.</p>
<p>The F-14 has an external power receptacle for AC power just aft of the nosegear, capable of driving aircraft AC and DC (through the transformer-rectifiers). External power is automatically disconnected from the aircraft power system when one of the internal generators come online.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-power"><a class="header" href="#emergency-power">Emergency Power</a></h2>
<p>The F-14 has an emergency generator driven by the combined hydraulic system generating a limited supply of AC and DC power. If the system loses main power the emergency generator takes over supply of flight critical systems within 1 second.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-indicators-2"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-indicators-2">Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../../img/generator1.png" alt="generator" /></p>
<p>The controls for the electrical systems are located on the master generator control panel.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>MASTER GEN switches:</strong> Control connection of the main generators to the electrical buses. The NORM position on the switches connect the individual generators to the buses. The OFF/RESET position disconnects the generator and also resets any protection circuits that might have cut in because of the power supply being outside normal limits. The TEST position starts the generator but do not connect it to the electrical buses making it possible to test the generator without affecting other aircraft systems. The switch is locked to the on position and needs to be lifted to move it to the OFF/RESET position from NORM.</li>
<li><strong>EMERG switch:</strong> Controls the emergency generator. In the NORM position the emergency generator is automatically connected to the essential buses if the main generators fail. The OFF/RESET position deactivates the emergency generator and also resets the associated protection circuits if tripped. The switch is guarded to the NORM position and that guard needs to be opened to move the switch to OFF/RESET.</li>
</ol>
<p>Associated caution and advisory lights are located on the pilot Caution - Advisory Indicator. The L GEN and R GEN lights, when illuminated, indicate that the respective generator is not functioning correctly. Either because of a fault or because the engine driving the generator not running.</p>
<p>The TRANS/RECT advisory light indicates that only one or none of the transformer-rectifiers are functioning.</p>
<p>The emergency generator can be tested by selection of EMERG GEN on the MASTER TEST switch on the Master Test Panel. Completion of the test is indicated by the GO light illuminating. In case of a fault the NO GO light illuminates.</p>
<h2 id="circuit-breakers"><a class="header" href="#circuit-breakers">Circuit Breakers</a></h2>
<p>The circuit breakers in the F-14 are located on the pilot’s right and left knee panels and behind the RIO’s seat on his left and right sides. The breakers protect aircraft systems from overcurrent by popping out and isolating the system drawing too much current. This is indicated by a white line becoming visible on the breaker as it pops out. The breaker can be reset by pushing it in and it can also be pulled out manually.</p>
<p>These breakers will be detailed here when implemented in DCS.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lighting-system"><a class="header" href="#lighting-system">Lighting System</a></h1>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat lighting system consists of the internal and the external lights.</p>
<h2 id="internal-lighting"><a class="header" href="#internal-lighting">Internal Lighting</a></h2>
<p>The internal lights are the red instrument panel and console lights, red and white floodlights, and a movable utility light at both crew stations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Red instrument panel and console lights:</strong> Normally used during nighttime, they back-light all instruments and controls, allowing their use while impacting night vision minimally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Floodlights:</strong> Allow for additional lighting of the cockpit panels, but care should be taken to avoid affecting night vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utility lights:</strong> Movable and can be used to illuminate a specific spot and as a map or reading light.</p>
<p>Controls for the internal lights are on the Master Light Control Panel in the pilot cockpit and Interior Light Control Panel in the RIO cockpit, each controlling their own cockpit lighting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The utility light function is not modeled in DCS, but the flashlight function, default keybind Left Alt + L, which moves with the cursor, can be used, providing a similar function.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="external-lighting"><a class="header" href="#external-lighting">External Lighting</a></h2>
<p>The external lights are the position lights, the anticollision lights, the formation lights, the taxi light, the approach lights, and the refueling probe light.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Position lights:</strong> Located on the left wing tip (red), right wing tip (green), top aft of the left vertical stabilizer (white), and upper and lower lights on the wing gloves on each side (red on the left glove and green on the right). The glove lights are additional lights supplementing the wing tip lights. When the wings are swept forward of 25°, the wing tip lights are active, and when aft of 25°, the glove lights are active instead. With the gear down, wings forward of 25°, and the position lights in steady mode, both the glove and wingtip position lights are lit. When the anticollision lights are on, the position lights can only operate in the steady mode; otherwise, they can be set to flash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anticollision lights:</strong> Located on the chin pod or TCS pod, top front of the left vertical stabilizer, and top aft of the right vertical stabilizer. The anticollision lights are all red flashing lights. The chin pod-mounted lower light only operates while the nosegear wheel door is closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formation lights:</strong> Dim green lights used for formation flight, which can be dimmed gradually. They are located on the aircraft nose (behind the radome), the wing tips, on the fuselage aft of the wings, and on the top edge of the vertical stabilizers. All are duplicated on both sides of the aircraft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxi light:</strong> A fixed headlight located on the nosewheel strut. It’s automatically turned off with gear retraction if set to on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approach lights:</strong> Located on the nosewheel strut and replicate the AoA indexer for the LSOs during carrier traps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refueling probe light:</strong> Used to illuminate the refueling probe and is automatically enabled with probe extension.</p>
<p>All external light controls are located on the Master Light Control Panel, except for the exterior lights switch on the left throttle (see Throttle), which disables or enables all external lights apart from the approach lights.</p>

<p><em>"I'll tell you what, it's got a fine radar inside, the APQ-120,
you can get a skin paint on a skeeter 200 miles, or a stealth fighter."</em></p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_dish_nose.jpg" alt="Radar Dish" />
<em>A technician works on the AN/APQ-120(V) fire control radar in the nose
of a 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing F-4E Phantom II aircraft</em></p>
<p>The Westinghouse AN/APQ-120 Fire Control Radar, a continuation of the F-4C's
-100 and the 4D's 109, is a solid state pulse radar providing the F-4E with air
to air intercept functionality, air to ground mapping, ground target reference
provision to the LABS and WRCS bombing systems, as well as radar beacon
capability. The APQ-120 also functions as the display system for TISEO and TV
guided weapon imagery, and is integrated with the
<a href="systems/radar/../identification_systems.html#interrogator-systems">APX-80 interrogation system</a>.</p>
<p>The primary conversion from the APQ-109 to APQ-120 included a reduction in the
number of field replaceable units in the nose, as well as the reduction in their
size; whereas the -109 had been a hybrid in its movement towards solid state
hardware (primarily in the low voltage processing sections), the 120 was a fully
solid-state system. While this update reduced the space overhead and weight for
the system, the modification of the F-4 nose to include the
<a href="systems/radar/../../stores/guns.html#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan">M61 cannon</a> required a
reduction in antenna size, causing a marginal decrease in overall detection
range. However, when taken with the increase in system reliability and reduced
maintenance, the tradeoff was considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Starting with production of the F-4E block 60, and retrofitted to selected
earlier block aircraft, was the addition of the Digital Scan Converter Group
display. The inclusion of DSCG increased the overall ease of handling the
APQ-120 by adding additional information on the display directly, including
current radar range setting and the calculated range rate value against the
current acquired target. Further, clarity of the display in all lighting
conditions was improved by rendering the radar reference grids directly as part
of the displayed image, rather than the previously used markings on the DVST
glass. In addition, the DSCG provided the ability of the two crew members to
utilize the displays independently; previously, the WSO had control over which
mode both the DVST and front seat repeater display would show. With DSCG, the
pilot could utilize TISEO or TV air to ground weapons while the WSO maintained a
scan pattern or found a ground reference point and inserted it into the WRCS.</p>

<p>The APQ-120 is a pulse radar. The radar transmits a radio pulse focused
in one direction via the antenna.</p>
<p>Any obstacle in that direction, for example another aircraft or simply ground,
will reflect part of the energy back, which the radar then receives via
the antenna to be processed and evaluated by the crew.
Based on the time it took for the signal to travel back, the radar
computes the distance to the obstacle.</p>
<p>All radar returns are then displayed on the screen <strong>based on their distance</strong>,
resulting in a <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>unfiltered</strong> representation of the world in
front of the aircraft.</p>
<p>However, since the emitter is not a perfect device, energy is transmitted into all
directions, with the main focus being the direction in which the antenna is
pointing at. This is referred to as the <strong>main lobe</strong> of the antenna, while any
other unwanted returns from different directions are called <strong>side lobes</strong>.</p>

<p>The AN/AWG-9 weapons control system (WCS) is an integrated system containing the F-14’s main sensors and computer providing detection, tracking, and engagement of targets in the air-to-air and air-to-ground roles.</p>
<h2 id="detail-data-display-ddd-and-panel"><a class="header" href="#detail-data-display-ddd-and-panel">Detail Data Display (DDD) and Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/dddpanel.png" alt="DDD Panel" /></p>
<p>The DDD is the main control panel and display for the radar part of the AN/AWG-9 system. It contains all the controls for the radar except the scan volume and stabilization controls which are on the sensor control panel.</p>
<h3 id="tgts-mlc-agc-and-paramp-switches"><a class="header" href="#tgts-mlc-agc-and-paramp-switches">TGTS, MLC, AGC and PARAMP Switches</a></h3>
<p>The upper left part of the DDD panel contains four switches (1-4) controling amplification, mainlobe clutter (MLC) suppression and target size parameters.</p>
<p>The TGTS (targets) switch selects expected target size which is used by the WCS to calculate missile launch zones and set parameters for target tracking in the radar. It also sets the range at which the missile ATC is sent, SMALL being 6NM, NORM 10NM and LARGE 13NM. The selected position of this switch might negatively affect target tracking and engagement if set incorrectly.</p>
<p>The MLC switch controls how the system supresses the MLC in the radar system while in pulse doppler mode. The OUT position disables the system while the IN position enables it. The AUTO position automatically enables the MLC filter if the antenna look-up angle is less than 3°.</p>
<p>The AGC switch controls the automatic gain control and is used in the pulse doppler modes to allow control of the time constant used for the AGC. Normally (NORM position) the AGC uses a longer time constant to calculate a mean value used for amplification. If the radar is operating in a jammed environment or heavy clutter is present the AGC can be set to use a faster time constant to mitigate these factors but this setting can also make the radar less sensitive to real targets.</p>
<p>The PARAMP, parametric amplifier switch allows for manual control of the parametric amplifier which is used to amplify weaker targets in all radar modes. Normally the WCS controls when to use the PARAMP depending on range but if tracking an unusually strong target it can be used to disable PARAMP to lessen the effect from background noise. If set to off manually it lessens the detection range by approximately 35%.</p>

<h3 id="awg-9-range-selection-and-tracking-indication"><a class="header" href="#awg-9-range-selection-and-tracking-indication">AWG-9 Range Selection and Tracking Indication</a></h3>
<p>In the upper central part of the DDD panel are located the controls and indicators for setting the radar range in the search modes. Below these are also present the indicators for radar tracking while in the single target track (STT) modes.</p>
<p>The six round buttons (8), which are labelled 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200, are used to set desired radar range in pulse modes and IFF range, they also set the scale on the pilot target range displays. The buttons are mutually exclusive as only one range can be selected at a time. In pulse search this setting affects the PRF of the radar and the scale on the DDD and if set to 20nm or greater range it also enables pulse compression.</p>
<p>The range display drum (7) indicates currently displayed scale on the DDD for the pulse modes and is blank when using pulse-doppler. It can also show ±10 for when using the IFF interrogator in the STT modes.</p>
<p>Below these are the four radar track indicator lights which are used to indicate how the radar tracks the target in STT.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ANT TRK</strong>: Indicates the radar is tracking the target angle (azimuth and elevation).</li>
<li><strong>RDROT</strong>: Indicates the target is in the range or rate gate.</li>
<li><strong>JAT</strong>: Indicates the antenna is tracking a jamming source’s angle.</li>
<li><strong>IROT</strong>: Indicates target angle tracking via TCS.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ir-audio-controls"><a class="header" href="#ir-audio-controls">IR AUDIO Controls</a></h3>
<p>The IR AUDIO controls (10-12) in the upper right part of the DDD panel were used with the original IR-sensor and are non-functional in modelled F-14 versions.</p>
<h2 id="radar-and-missile-frequency-selectors"><a class="header" href="#radar-and-missile-frequency-selectors">Radar and Missile Frequency Selectors</a></h2>
<p>The thumbwheels in the upper rightmost part of the DDD panel are used to control the AN/AWG-9 radar emitter’s frequency (13) and the missile control channel used with the AIM-7 and AIM-54 (14). Adjustment of these might be needed to avoid interference from other AN/AWG-9 equipped aircraft or other external sources. The WCS reads the missile channel for the AIM-7 as the missiles are prepared as they need to be tuned and changing the channel after this will not affect a change unless the preparation sequence is restarted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Non-functional in DCS currently.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="radar-mode-selectors"><a class="header" href="#radar-mode-selectors">Radar Mode Selectors</a></h3>
<p>In the lower right part of the DDD panel are located the controls for display mode and radar mode and its indicator drum. The display mode buttons (15) selects what mode is currently selected for display on the DDD. The RDR, radar, mode is the normally selected mode. The IR mode is non-functional as the IR system is not installed. The IFF button enables the IFF interrogator in one of its two operational modes, for more detail see the IFF section in the General design and systems overview chapter.</p>
<p>The radar mode buttons (16) selects the operational mode of the AN/AWG-9 radar. The two STT buttons, pulse-doppler single target track (PD STT) and pulse single target track (P STT), enables selection of an STT mode if available and relevant. These are used to automatically attempt an STT lockon onto a hooked TID target or to transfer between these two STT modes. The pulse doppler search button (PD SRCH) selects the PD SEARCH mode of the radar. The range-while-search button (RWS) selects the RWS mode of the radar. The two track-while-scan buttons (TWS AUTO and TWS MAN) selects their respective TWS modes for use in the radar. The pulse search button (PULSE SRCH) selects the pulse search mode of the radar.</p>
<p>The indicator drum (17) shows currently selected radar mode. Apart from TWS MAN, TWS AUTO, RWS which refers to their respective modes it can also show MRL (manual rapid lockon), A-G (air-to-ground), VSL (vertical scan lockon), OPTTRK (TCS track), PLM (pilot lockon mode), PULSE (for both pulse search and pulse STT), PD (for both pulse dopple search and PD STT) and PAL (pilot automatic lockon mode).</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="aspect-and-vc-switches"><a class="header" href="#aspect-and-vc-switches">Aspect and Vc Switches</a></h3>
<p>On opposite sides of the DDD itself are located the ASPECT and VC switches. The Vc switch (18) controls the rate scale on the DDD in the pulse doppler search modes. X-4 sets the scale to 800 knots opening to 4,000 knots closing, NORM sets the scale to 200 knots opening to 1,000 knots closing and VID sets the scale to 50 knots opening to 250 knots closing.</p>
<p>The ASPECT switch (21) controls two different things depending on radar mode. In the pulse doppler search modes it controls the rate processing windows of the radar, NOSE sets 600 knots opening to 1,800 knots closing, BEAM sets 1,200 knots closing to 1,200 knots opening and TAIL sets 1,800 knots opening to 600 knots closing. In the short pulse STT modes the switch sets the system tracking mode to the corresponding echo edge or centroid to counteract countermeasures like chaff and specific jammer modes.</p>
<h3 id="elevation-indicator"><a class="header" href="#elevation-indicator">Elevation Indicator</a></h3>
<p>The elevation indicator scale, EL, (22) is used to indicate the sensor elevations. The left (RDR) needle indicates current actual radar elevation. This indicator will move with the antenna in the radar search modes.</p>
<p>If the HCU is set to RDR the right (IR/TV/EC) needle indicates the currently set elevation center of the antenna scan pattern. This is usefull in STT as it enables the RIO to set the antenna elevation center to use when you eventually revert to search.</p>
<p>If the HCU is set to IR/TV the right needle instead displays current TCS elevation.</p>
<h3 id="counter-countermeasure-mode-controls"><a class="header" href="#counter-countermeasure-mode-controls">Counter-Countermeasure Mode Controls</a></h3>
<p>In the lower leftmost corner are located the three counter-countermeasure mode buttons. These controls functionality to counter different jammers affecting the system. (Not currently implemented)</p>
<h3 id="radar-and-ddd-control-knobs"><a class="header" href="#radar-and-ddd-control-knobs">Radar and DDD Control Knobs</a></h3>
<p>Spread out on the DDD panel are eight different knobs controlling differing functions on the DDD and radar. On the upper left side of the DDD is located the PULSE VIDEO control knob (5) which controls the video intensity on the DDD for the pulse modes. It affects only the DDD display, not the radar itself.</p>
<p>On the upper right side of the DDD is located the BRIGHT control knob (9) which adjusts a polarized filter which allows for mechanical control of the brightness of the DDD, mainly used in low light conditions.</p>
<p>On the lower left side of the DDD is located the PULSE GAIN control knob (20) which controls the radar gain in the pulse modes. This control affects the gain of the radar directly. Normally left in the detent at the fully clockwise position which allows the WCS to control it automatically.</p>
<p>On the lower right side of the DDD is located the ERASE control knob (19) which controls the strength of the erase beam on the DDD. The erase beam is what erases the indications continually on the DDD and thus affects how long the after-image of the detected targets will remain.</p>
<p>On the left side of the DDD panel are located the PD THRLD (26), JAM/JET (24) and ACM THRLD (25) control knobs. The pulse-doppler threshold knobs (PD THRLD) controls the threshold at which an echo is regarded as a contact, displayed on the DDD and tracked on the TID in RWS and TWS. The CLEAR knob controls the clear region threshold (upper half of the DDD) and the CLUTTER knob controls the clutter region (lower half of the DDD). Normally left in the clockwise NORM detents, letting the WCS automatically control them.</p>
<p>The JAM/JET control knob selects the threshold of what jamming intensity signal strength is needed to regard an emitter as a jammer and make it indicate a jammer strobe on the TID. The ACM THRLD sets the threshold for what to regard as a target at ACM ranges. Normally left in the counter-clockwise detent, letting the WCS automatically control it.</p>

<p>The DDD screen itself shows either only radar return data or radar returns combined with symbology depending on radar mode.</p>
<p>In the pulse search mode the display shows only radar returns and the a visual representation of the radar sweep and erase sweep. The screen shows range vs azimuth in this mode. In pulse doppler modes the AGC TRACE is added on the bottom showing supposed jamming intensity of the detected targets. The screen shows rate vs azimuth in these modes.</p>
<p>In the two STT modes the display shows, in addition to the return from the target, the tracking gates (either range or range rate gate), a closing rate indication on the right side and the attack symbology if in air-to-air mode and a missile is selected.</p>
<p>In pulse STT the target is displayed at the correct azimuth and range while in pulse doppler STT the target is shifted to the left side of the display and a generated target symbol is at the correct azimuth instead. In pulse doppler STT the AGC TRACE is added as well to give an indication of jamming strength. For information about the attack symbology see the VDIG section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: AGC TRACE not yet implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the IFF interrogator is activated it superimposes the IFF information on top of the normal radar picture if in pulse search. In pulse doppler search the DDD switches to range vs azimuth at the previously set range scale while the IFF information is shown and in PD STT, if the target is hooked on the TID the DDD switches to a ±10 scale centered on the target while the IFF returns are shown.</p>
<h2 id="tactical-information-display-tid-and-associated-controls"><a class="header" href="#tactical-information-display-tid-and-associated-controls">Tactical Information Display (TID) and Associated Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/tid1.png" alt="TID" /></p>
<p>The TID is the main data display for the WCS. It displays a tactical picture to the RIO which is used to identify and select targets for the long range weapons on the F-14 Tomcat. Think of it as a top down map showing the relative coordinates of all presented tracks and symbols, but without a representation of the ground/surface features (map). It is also used in secondary roles as a display for entering data into the WCS, for navigation, for INS alignment and for the on board checkout, OBC.</p>
<h3 id="tid-display-control-knobs"><a class="header" href="#tid-display-control-knobs">TID Display Control Knobs**:</a></h3>
<p>On the upper edge of the TID are two display control knobs (2 &amp; 4). The left one controls the contrast of the TCS display and the right one controls the overall brightness of the TID. Both settings will depend on user preference and ambient lighting.</p>
<h3 id="ins-and-navigational-controls"><a class="header" href="#ins-and-navigational-controls">INS and Navigational Controls**:</a></h3>
<p>On the upper left corner of the TID is the status display for the INS (1), used to indicate status of the INS and its alignment.</p>
<p>To the sides of the TID are located two selector knobs. The one on the left side (12) controls and selects the INS or AHRS mode to use. It also allows for INS alignment.</p>
<p>On the right side is the selector knob (6) controlling the source used when destination steering is selected by the pilot. Selects between the different waypoints stored in the WCS. MAN position is used only for aircraft with TARPS mounted.</p>
<p>Adjacent to this selector is a readout drum on the upper right edge of the TID (5). It’s used to indicate the type of steering information currently displayed to the pilot.</p>
<p>Possible steering type shown are: destination (DEST), data link command heading (D/L), azimuth lead collision steering (LD CLSN), collision steering (CLSN), lead pursuit steering (LD PURST), pursuit steering (PURST), TACAN radial (TACAN) and manually set commanded heading (MAN).</p>
<h3 id="tid-data-readout-drum"><a class="header" href="#tid-data-readout-drum">TID Data Readout Drum</a></h3>
<p>Above the TID is located the data readout indicator drum (3). It’s used to indicate the source of the data displayed on the TID text readouts. Possible readouts are: the different waypoints in the navigational system (WAY PT, ST, FIX PT, IP and HB), own aircraft (OWN A/C), first priority target (TGT 1) and SYMBOL.</p>
<p>Symbol indicates that the readout displays data for a hooked symbol on the TID which doesn’t have its own indicator text on the drum. The drum can also show a blank face to indicate the data source as one not having its own indicator text and which has no symbol on the TID.</p>
<h3 id="track-hold-and-clsn-buttons"><a class="header" href="#track-hold-and-clsn-buttons">TRACK HOLD and CLSN buttons</a></h3>
<p>Below the selector knobs on the sides of the TID are two buttons with indicator lights, one on each side. The lights illuminates green to indicate selection.</p>
<p>On the left side is the TRACK HOLD button (11) which enables the track hold function. Normally targets on the TID in TWS mode are retained 14 seconds after last observation. The track hold function extends this two 2 minutes for all tracks. If disabled it reverts to the standard 14 second period, whereafter the targets will be dropped if no new observations occur.</p>
<p>On the right side is the CLSN button (7) enabling collision steering to currently tracked target or centroid if in TWS. This selection overrides the current steering information presented to the pilot with the collision steering, only exception being if the pilot selects the ACM.</p>
<h3 id="tid-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#tid-control-panel">TID Control Panel</a></h3>
<p>Below the TID is the TID control panel (8). It contains 8 buttons selecting what symbology to show on the TID, these illuminates green when active. It also contains two selector knobs controlling display scale and TID mode. The buttons are:</p>

<h2 id="navigation-command-and-control-grid-nav-grid"><a class="header" href="#navigation-command-and-control-grid-nav-grid">Navigation Command and Control Grid (NAV GRID)</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/navgrid.png" alt="NAV GRID" /></p>
<p>The Navigation Command and Control Grid or NAV GRID was designed to enable easy navigation and CAP control from a common fixed reference point. It enables TID readout of bearing and range from that set reference point, called YY. While NAV GRID is active displayed range and bearing on the TID for hooks and own aircraft is indicated relative YY. Additionally it also displays a grid extending from YY along a set threat axis. The purpose of the grid itself is to allow for quick position reference while a precise readout is available for a hooked target. This is where the name NAV GRID originates.</p>
<p>Lastly it also allows for display of something called Voice Codes. These are displayed for current hook alternating with the altitude readout on the TID if ALT NUM is selected for display. It indicates bearing from YY in tens (15 reading as 150 as an example) followed by a letter indicating range. A would indicate 0-50nm while B indicates 50-100nm and so on for consecutive letters.</p>
<p>The standard NAV GRID display mode is GND STAB and this allows for the grid itself to be visible. If A/C STAB or ATTK display modes are selected only the Voice Code display functionality is retained but it addition to the normal functionality the Ownship Symbol will always display its Voice Code.</p>
<p>As default the grid origin, YY, is positioned at the edge of the TID extending outwards along the set threat axis. The grid can be set to have between 1 and 6 sectors display, all being outlined meaning that the one sector display will have 2 lines delineating the limits and 6 having 7 lines. The size of the sectors depend on the total grid coverage, which can be up to 180 degrees, which is then divided into the selected number of sectors. Along the sector demarkation lines are drawn range indicator marks at 50nm intervals, the 50nm marks being shorter than the even 100nm markers.</p>
<p>The ground stab view as well as the grid can be offset as normal by the RIO via the HCU. To reset the offset, cycle to any aircraft stabilized mode and back to GND STAB.</p>
<p>While the original purpose of this functionality was intended for fleet defence use it works perfectly fine as a bulls-eye reference in DCS with YY set to the bulls-eye. The only real limitation being the grid only displaying along the threat axis and not all around.</p>

<h3 id="hcu-power-controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#hcu-power-controls-and-indicators">HCU Power Controls and Indicators</a></h3>
<p>The controls on the HCU stick are: the action trigger switch (11), elevation vernier control (10), the OFFSET button (9) and the MRL button (8). The action trigger on the forward side of the stick has two detents, the half-action first detent and the full-action second detent. Half-action enables display of the cursor for the selected mode except when in TCS mode where it enables stick control of TCS elevation and azimuth. In the radar mode it additionally enables the super search acqusition mode in the radar (See chapter about radar transitional modes for more information). Full-action, when enabled tells the TCS to lockon to a target in the TCS mode if a target is present in its acquisition gates. In the radar mode it tells the radar to attempt lockon to a target in the radar range/rate gates at the set azimuth. In the DDD and TID modes it marks the current cursor position or, in the case of the TID mode, tries to hook a symbol if present within 0.125 inches on the display.</p>
<p>The elevation vernier control is a thumbwheel on the left side of the stick used in the TCS and radar modes to fine tune sensor elevation ±4° for target acquisition, this elevation deflection is added to the normal sensor elevation control. The OFFSET button on the top of the stick is used to offset any of the TID tactical displays, moving the own aircraft symbol to the TID cursor spot hook (if present) and the rest of the symbology relative to that. This function is reset and all the symbols are moved to the original positions by cycling the TID display mode selector to another mode and back. The MRL button on the right side of the stick is used to enable the manual rapid lockon mode (MRL) for target acquisition. See Manual Rapid Lockon (MRL) for more information.</p>
<p>The stick itself functions differently depending on selected HCU mode. In all cases the stick is only enabled with the action trigger depressed and all modes control sensor or cursor position absolutely meaning that a given deflection of the stick always moves the sensor or cursor to the same position. In the TCS mode X (up/down) controls TCS elevation and Y (left/right) controls TCS azimuth. In the radar mode X controls the range or rate of the radar acquisition gate on the DDD and Y controls the gate in azimuth in a similar fashion. In the two cursor modes X controls up/down of the cursor on the respective screen and Y controls left/right of the same.</p>

<ul>
<li>Selection of symbol/function -&gt; Prefix selection for display -&gt; Data entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data readout and entry on the TID always follows the following sequence: Selection of symbol/function -&gt; Prefix selection for display -&gt; Data entry.</p>
<p>Selection of desired symbol or function can be achieved either via TID hook or via the CAP MESSAGE buttons available under the different categories on the CAP DRUM.</p>
<p>Most data readout prefixes displays multiple readouts, as an example calling up either latitude and longitude shows both and calling up range also displays bearing and vice versa but the selected prefix is the one used for data entry.</p>
<p>To select another prefix for data readout without reselecting the message function the CLEAR key on the CAP is used, this resets the readout and allows for selection of a new prefix. As it’s possible that depression of a prefix button is read as a data entry if a prefix is already selected it’s normally recommended to reset using CLEAR before reselecting a new prefix. This makes the recommended sequence: Selection of symbol/function -&gt; CLEAR -&gt; Prefix selection for display -&gt; Data entry.</p>
<p>To enter new data into selected prefix the RIO enters desired data after the prefix selection, checks it is correct and then enters it with the ENTER key. The TID readout is then updated with the new data. To clear the data without entering it, instead use the CLEAR key.</p>

<p>The upper half of panel contains controls for the radar antenna scan pattern. The STAB (stabilization) switch controls whether the radar antenna scan pattern is stabilized relative to the horizon (IN) or not. If in OUT instead meaning that the scan pattern is relative to the F-14 aircraft armament datum line (ADL). The WCS computer can override this setting if necessary. The AZ CTR (azimuth control) and EL CTR (elevation control) knobs sets the elevation and azimuth centerpoint of the antenna scan pattern. The azimuth control moves the azimuth scan center within 65° degrees of the aircraft centerline, this is disabled if azimuth scan width is set to ±65° as it already scans the whole available azimuth range. Do not move the scan pattern so that it scans outside of 65° from aircraft centerline as this might damage the antenna as it might hit the antenna azimuth stops. The elevation control moves the elevation position of the bottom bar of the elevation scan pattern relative to zero elevation. It can move from -76° to +54°. Both control knobs have marked centerpoints, being aircraft centerline and zero elevation respectively.</p>
<p>The AZ SCAN (azimuth scan) and EL BARS (elevation bars) selector knobs controls the size of the antenna scan pattern. The AZ SCAN selector knob has four settings, ±10°, ±20°, ±40° and ±65°. The EL BARS selector knob also has four settings, 1, 2, 4 or 8 bars. 1 bar being 2.3°, 2 bars 3.6°, 4 bars 6.3° and 8 bars 11.5°. The reason for the elevation coverage not equalling one bar times the number of bars being that the bars overlap slightly.</p>
<p>The last radar control on the panel is the VSL switch. Momentary selection of VSL HIGH or LOW activates the vertical scan lockon acquisition mode (VSL). (See Vertical Scan Lockon (VSL))</p>
<h3 id="tcs-controls"><a class="header" href="#tcs-controls">TCS Controls</a></h3>
<p>On the right side of the panel the SLAVE switch controls which sensor is slaved to the other or none slaved at all. In the center position the sensors move individually from each other. In RDR the radar is slaved to the TCS line of sight while a TCS track is present. In TCS the TCS is slaved to the radar line of sight if a an STT or JAT exists. Both modes can be used to allow a sensor to guide a sensor to lock onto whatever the other sensor is currently tracking.</p>
<p>The TCS TRIM knobs controls TCS calibration in azimuth (AZ) and elevation (EL). This is used to calibrate the TCS line of sight to be equal to the radar line of sight. Normally this is done by locking a target in STT, setting slave to TCS and then fine-tuning the calibration knobs until the TCS looks directly at the locked target.</p>
<p>The last two switches controlling the TCS are the ACQ (acquisition) and FOV (field of view) switches. The ACQ switch controls how the TCS locks onto targets. AUTO SRCH means the TCS will move by itself in a limited search pattern trying to find a target. MAN (manual) means the TCS only locks onto targets if commanded to by the HCU in TCS mode and AUTO means the TCS automatically tries to lock onto targets entering its field of view. The FOV switch sets whether the WIDE or NAR (narrow) field of view is used by the TCS.</p>
<p>The lower part of the panel contains controls for the airborne video tape recorder (AVTR) controlling and indicating power mode and time remaining on tape. This is currently not modelled in DCS.</p>

<p>The AN/AWG-9 radar in the F-14 is an all-weather, multi-mode pulse doppler radar using the X-band (X-band being 8-12 GHz). It was designed specifically to be a long range radar system capable of guiding up to 6 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles using its track while scan mode. One originally envisioned scenario was its use as a long range fleet defender intercepting russian bombers and attack aircraft threatening the fleet. During the F-14’s later service life this mission transitioned more towards the anti-fighter side, a mission for which it was very well adapted.</p>
<p>The AN/AWG-9 radar has two basic operational modes, pulse and pulse doppler, each with its own pros and cons. Below is a table listing function, weapons capability, expected range and target data available.</p>

<h2 id="pulse-mode"><a class="header" href="#pulse-mode">Pulse Mode</a></h2>
<p>In the pulse mode of operation the AN/AWG-9 does not use pulse doppler filtering which means that it can be used to detect targets at all aspects and also be used for rudimentary ground mapping. On the pro side this means that the radar in this mode cannot be notched as it does not need to have a relative speed to register the target. The downside however is that the radar does not have an easy way of differentiate between unwanted ground reflections and real targets meaning that aircraft can hide in the ground clutter near the ground. Because of this and the increased difficulty from trying to differentiate real targets from the general background noise without doppler filtering means that the range in the pulse modes are less than in the pulse doppler modes.</p>
<p>The radar has two pulse modes, pulse search and pulse single target track (P-STT).</p>
<h3 id="pulse-search"><a class="header" href="#pulse-search">Pulse Search</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/PSEARCH.png" alt="Pulse Search" /></p>
<p>Pulse search is used to search for and find airborne targets at range.</p>
<p>It is possible to use this radar mode as a basic ground mapper as well which can be useful for navigation and navigational fixes and can also be used in a pinch to detect larger surface targets like ships. Keep in mind though that the radar is not built with this as its main function and that a real air-to-ground radar will outperform it handily.</p>
<p>In this mode the radar cannot by itself differentiate targets and generate tracks meaning that the WCS will not generate track files and display anything on the TID. This also means that pulse search is not capable of guiding missiles.</p>
<p>The DDD in this mode will display a radar image indicating the azimuth and range of targets at selected scale and it is possible to transition to P STT using the RDR mode with the HCU stick. It is possible to select ground or aircraft stabilized modes of operation using the STAB switch on the sensor control panel.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-single-target-track-p-stt"><a class="header" href="#pulse-single-target-track-p-stt">Pulse Single Target Track (P STT)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/PSTT.png" alt="Pulse STT" /></p>
<p>Pulse STT is used to track a single target, like pulse search mode it is not susceptible to notching but it is to ground clutter. The fact that the STT modes use gates to track the target, in this case range gates, means that it is less susceptible to ground clutter but a target close enough to the ground that the ground return enters the range gates would be likely to shake the lock.</p>
<p>As it is only in the pulse doppler modes that the missile guidance commands can be sent pulse STT is limited to launching AIM-7s in CW mode and AIM-54s in active launch mode limiting their ranges. At short ranges, ACM ranges, it is possible to use the ASPECT switch to set what aspect of the target to track, this is just to counter different types of countermeasures. As an example, if set to NOSE the radar will be less susceptible to chaff as the radar weights its track towards the targets leading edge (nose) away from the chaff being launched behind the target.</p>
<p>A successful track is indicated by the ANT TRK and RDROT indicator lights on the DDD, meaning that the antenna is tracking the target and that the target is within the range gates. If the target is jamming with sufficient strength, negating a range track, the radar will transition to a jam angle track instead, indicated by the JAT indicator light on the DDD illuminating instead of the RDROT. When range tracking is again possible at closer ranges the radar will transition to that instead.</p>
<p>The DDD in this mode will be similar to the pulse search mode but the antenna will be locked onto the target and not scan. Additionally the DDD will show the range gates around the target, a closing rate symbol at the right scale and applicable attack symbology if a valid missile is selected.</p>
<h2 id="pulse-doppler-mode"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-mode">Pulse Doppler Mode</a></h2>
<p>In pulse doppler mode the AN/AWG-9 uses doppler filters to filter out unwanted returns, enhancing target detection and thus increasing detection range. The pros of this mode being that, as said, targets can be detected at greater ranges, ground returns mostly eliminated and missile guidance commands be sent to AIM-7 and AIM-54 missiles. The AIM-54 both in TWS and STT and the AIM-7 in STT only. The biggest con of this mode being that it is susceptible to notching as a target returning zero relative speed will be filtered out.</p>
<p>The pulse doppler modes of the AN/AWG-9 are, pulse doppler search, range while search, track while scan and pulse doppler STT. The three search modes have a common DDD display, the main difference being that pulse doppler search has a slightly better range as the other two modes need to process FM-ranging to enable range indication of tracked targets.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-search"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-search">Pulse Doppler Search</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/PDSEARCH.png" alt="Pulse Doppler Search" /></p>
<p>The DDD in the pulse doppler search modes displays returns at azimuth versus rate (closing speed) meaning that by reading only the DDD the RIO can only discern target closing speed and azimuth. The display indicates observed closure rate vs the ground (with own airspeed subtracted) as opposed to relative closure rate. While this means that a target directly ahead, moving directly towards the radar, will show true target airspeed this speed varies with target aspect and radar antenna azimuth. This reason for this is that the radar itself only reads relative airspeed which is then modified by subtracting own airspeed for display on the DDD.</p>
<p>At the bottom edge of the DDD the AGC-trace is displayed indicating radar return intensity enabling the RIO to discern jamming targets by their return strength. The jamming targets are shown as jamming strobes on the TID if they exceed the set jamming threshold (set by the JAM/JET knob on the DDD).</p>
<p>The scale shown on the DDD (what rate region is shown) can be set by the Vc switch on the DDD panel. X-4 sets the scale to 800 knots opening to 4 000 knots closing, NORM sets the scale to 200 knots opening to 1 000 knots closing and VID sets the scale to 50 knots opening to 250 knots closing. The operating range of the doppler filters can also be configured by the ASPECT switch on the same panel, NOSE sets 600 knots opening to 1 800 knots closing, BEAM sets 1200 knots closing to 1200 knots opening and TAIL sets 1 800 knots opening to 600 knots closing. This allows the RIO to optimize the doppler filters for a known target closing speed and this affects the whole radar processing unlike the Vc switch which only affects the DDD.</p>
<p>Because of the way the radar operates the doppler filters it will have two blind ranges. The main lobe clutter (MLC) region which contains most of the ground returns, including those returning with zero groundspeed and is 266 knots wide, centered around own aircraft groundspeed (133 knots slower and 133 knots faster). This is the reason that the radar can be notched as a target with the same relative groundspeed as the ground will also be filtered out. This is however only true for look-down conditions as when the radar antenna looks up into the sky this filter isn’t necessary and can be turned off. If the MLC switch on the DDD panel is in AUTO the radar will automatically turn off the MLC filter if looking more than 3 degrees above the horizon. It can also be turned off manually by the RIO but if the antenna looks down this can make the displays unusable in RWS and TWS as all of the ground returns will be sent to the computer for tracking. In whichever case, with the MLC filter off, the target cannot notch the AN/AWG-9 if it is above the radar.</p>
<p>The second filter, and second blind spot, of the radar is the zero doppler filter. This blind area is centered around a closure rate of negative own groundspeed, meaning a target moving away from own aircraft at the same speed as own aircraft. This blind area is a hardware limitation as it is a doppler radar mode it cannot detect targets without a doppler shift. The resulting blind area is 200 knots wide, meaning that a chased target moving at a speed of within 100 knots (+/-) of own groundspeed will be invisible to the radar. This means that when chasing a fleeing target it may very well be necessary to use the pulse modes instead.</p>
<p>Both filters vary with azimuth as own airspeed relative to target varies with aspect. Relative airspeed from a target at 45° will be less than a target at 0° as own speed vector will be pointing away from it slightly. This is the reason for the mainlobe clutter trace presenting a curve on the DDD as the observed speed of the returning ground returns will vary with azimuth.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/pd.png" alt="PD" /></p>
<p>Target groundspeed 900 knots, own airspeed 1200 knots. See table below for details, line of sight rate is the sum of target and own aircraft relative rate.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Look Angle</th><th>Line of Sight Rate</th><th>Target Heading</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Position 4 has the target in a flanking or “notching” position making it disappear inside the MLC filter or MLC ground return. In a look-up situation with the MLC filter disabled the target would still be visible.</p>
<p>Additionally, all pulse doppler search modes use ground stabilization exclusively and thus the STAB switch is inoperative.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-search-1"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-search-1">Pulse Doppler Search</a></h3>
<p>The pulse doppler search mode is used mainly as a kind of early warning mode. It is the search mode with the greatest detection range but it can display no range to the RIO, only closure rate. For this reason, the TID can display no track information.</p>
<h3 id="range-while-search-rws"><a class="header" href="#range-while-search-rws">Range While Search (RWS)</a></h3>
<p>In range while search a frequency measuring ranging mode is added (FM ranging) to allow the radar to measure range of tracked targets in addition to closure rate. This additional processing does however mean that the effective range of the radar is somewhat lesser. The display on the DDD is the same as in pulse doppler search, the TID however also shows tracks in this mode showing the targets as tracks momentarily as they’re scanned and displaying their position and altitude. The targets are shown for a maximum of two seconds or until the antenna again scans the same bar at the same azimuth at which time it is removed unless detected again. Maximum number of concurrently shown tracks are 48.</p>
<h3 id="track-while-scan-tws"><a class="header" href="#track-while-scan-tws">Track While Scan (TWS)</a></h3>
<p>The track while scan mode uses the same FM ranging as RWS with the same reduction in range compared to pulse doppler search and the DDD display is also the same. The main difference that the computer establishes track files and tracks up to 24 targets concurrently of which 18 can be shown on the TID at any given time.</p>
<p>As the computer routine calculating these tracks need a set track refresh time of 2 seconds this limits available azimuth scan area and bar settings to either 20° 4 bars or 40° 2 bars. When entering TWS the computer automatically selects the ±20° 4 bar scan disregarding the RIO set scan volumes unless those are set to ±40° 2 bars in which case that is used instead.</p>
<p>The TWS mode is also the only mode enabling guidance of the AIM-54 at multiple targets (up to six), and as soon as engagable targets are detected the computer starts assigning them a missile priority number according to optimal missile firing sequence.</p>
<p>The TWS has two submodes available, TWS Auto and TWS Manual, which one is used is selected by the RIO with the corresponding button on the DDD panel. What differs between the two is that in TWS auto the computer takes control of used scan volume and scan pattern azimuth and elevation as soon as target tracks are present. The WCS computer automatically tries to optimise the scan volume and direction so that tracking of the prioritized targets is maximised. If not selected before launch the WCS overrides as soon as the first AIM-54 is launched and selects TWS Auto.</p>
<p>In TWS the pilot is guided to the computed centroid of the tracked targets via the navigational cues and this centroid is also displayed on the TID as a small x-shaped cross.</p>
<p>For additional information about TWS symbology and missile guidance see TWS and TID Symbology.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-doppler-single-target-track-pd-stt"><a class="header" href="#pulse-doppler-single-target-track-pd-stt">Pulse Doppler Single Target Track (PD STT)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/PDSTT.png" alt="Pulse Doppler STT" /></p>
<p>The pulse doppler STT works and looks much like the pulse STT mode. It does however have the same advantages and disadvantages compared to pulse STT as the other pulse doppler modes compared to the pulse modes. This means that while much better at tracking a target close to the ground it is however vulnerable to notching.</p>
<p>The DDD display for pulse doppler STT looks like pulse STT display except that the target return and antenna azimuth display is moved to the left side of the screen and a generated synthetic target marker is displayed at the correct azimuth instead. This is so that the targets range can be displayed by the synthetic target unlike the other pulse doppler modes which only shows closure rate. The other symbology on the DDD in this mode are the same as in pulse STT.</p>
<p>Unlike in pulse STT however the AN/AWG-9 can send missile guidance commands in pulse doppler STT enabling launch of AIM-7 and AIM-54 in pulse doppler mode. This is the mode with the greatest launch ranges for those missiles with the disadvantage, in the case of the AIM-54, of only being able to engage one target at a time.</p>
<h2 id="transitional-modes"><a class="header" href="#transitional-modes">Transitional Modes</a></h2>
<p>The transitional modes are the ones used to transition into the single target tracks from the search modes, ACM modes, via TCS or between the two STT modes.</p>
<h3 id="hcu-stick-in-radar-mode"><a class="header" href="#hcu-stick-in-radar-mode">HCU Stick in Radar Mode</a></h3>
<p>When using the AN/AWG-9 radar in the different search modes it’s possible to manually use the HCU stick with radar mode selected to select a target on the DDD for STT lock.</p>
<p>Pressing the HCU trigger to half-action while in radar mode displays the acquisition gates on the DDD and enables the supersearch mode in the radar. In supersearch mode the antenna does a ±10° search pattern at the selected amount of bars around the acquisition gates.</p>
<p>The acquisition gates can then be steered over the detected position of the target with the HCU, left/right used to steer azimuth and up/down used to steer range or rate depending on if pulse or pulse doppler is used. The antenna elevation is then fine-tuned using the elevation vernier on the HCU until the target return is visible within the acquisition gates. At that time the RIO can then select full-action on the HCU trigger, commanding the radar to attempt a lockon at the commanded azimuth, range/rate and elevation.</p>
<p>If successfully executed the radar then transitions into the respective STT mode and the correct indicators on the DDD illuminates. Pulse STT is used if transitioning from pulse search and pulse doppler STT if transitioning from any of the pulse doppler search modes.</p>
<h3 id="tws-stt-acquisition"><a class="header" href="#tws-stt-acquisition">TWS STT Acquisition</a></h3>
<p>In TWS it is possible to attempt an STT lockon by hooking a track on the TID and then selecting either pulse STT or pulse doppler STT on the DDD panel. The WCS computer then commands the antenna in supersearch to the hooked tracks azimuth, range/rate and elevation and attempts a lockon if a target is detected.</p>
<p>Unlike in a manual HCU acquisition this process is completely automated but its success rate is also less than a manual transition.</p>
<h3 id="acm-modes"><a class="header" href="#acm-modes">ACM Modes</a></h3>
<p>The AN/AWG-9 has three distinct ACM acquisition modes. Pilot lockon mode (PLM), vertical scan lockon (VSL) and manual rapid lockon (MRL).</p>
<p>The ACM modes are listed in priority order, the different modes overriding other modes lower in the prioritization. This means that PLM always overrides VSL and lower modes and VSL overrides PAL and lower modes but not PLM and so on.</p>
<p>All of the modes can be exited by the RIO selecting half-action and release on the HCU except PLM which will be in effect until the pilot releases the PLM button.</p>
<h4 id="pilot-lockon-mode-plm"><a class="header" href="#pilot-lockon-mode-plm">Pilot Lockon Mode (PLM)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/plm.png" alt="PLM" /></p>
<p>The PLM is the ACM mode with the highest priority, it always overrides any other radar mode and is enabled when the pilot presses the PLM button on the front of the right throttle. Depression of that button commands the antenna to the armament datum line (ADL) and causes it to lock onto the first target seen out to 5 NM.</p>
<p>Thus the procedure to use PLM is for the pilot to fly the ADL marker on the HUD over the target and then press and hold the PLM button until lockon occurs. The PLM continues until a target is detected and transition to pulse STT occurs or the PLM button is released making the radar transition to pulse search instead.</p>
<h4 id="vertical-scan-lockon-vsl"><a class="header" href="#vertical-scan-lockon-vsl">Vertical Scan Lockon (VSL)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/vsl.png" alt="VSL" /></p>
<p>The VSL mode is enabled by the pilot or the RIO and is used to acquire a target at own aircraft's current heading from an elevation of -15° to +55°. The RIO can use the VSL switch on the sensor control panel in the RIO cockpit. Two submodes are available by placing the switch into either VSL HI (high) or VSL LO (low) and releasing it back to center. The pilot can enable VSL HI or LO by selecting UP or DN respectively on the target designate switch when not in A/G mode.</p>
<p>This commands the antenna to start a volume 5° wide in a circular fashion. If VSL HI is commanded the vertical area covered is from +15° to +55° and if VSL LO is commanded the area covered is from -15° to +25°. VSL is indicated on the HUD by the diamond moving with antenna line of sight indicating its current position.</p>
<p>When a target is detected within 5 NM the radar transitions into pulse STT, otherwise it continues in VSL until another mode is selected.</p>
<h4 id="pilot-automatic-lockon-pal"><a class="header" href="#pilot-automatic-lockon-pal">Pilot Automatic Lockon (PAL)</a></h4>
<p>PAL is enabled by the pilot selecting DES on the target designate switch when not in A/G mode.</p>
<p>PAL commands the antenna to an 8-bar ±20° scan pattern locking onto the first target detected out to 15 NM. This mode is indicated by the diamond on the HUD following current antenna line of sight.</p>
<h4 id="manual-rapid-lockon-mrl"><a class="header" href="#manual-rapid-lockon-mrl">Manual Rapid Lockon (MRL)</a></h4>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/mrl.png" alt="MRL" /></p>
<p>The manual rapid lockon (MRL) mode allows the RIO to quickly acquire a target within the antenna limits out to 5 NM. When the MRL button on the right side of the HCU stick is depressed it commands the radar to start a one-bar supersearch pattern out to 5 NM.</p>
<p>The HCU stick controls the supersearch pattern in azimuth and elevation (left/right controlling azimuth and up/down controlling elevation). The DDD displays a normal supersearch pattern in 5 NM scale and additionally two tick marks are shown at the edge of the scan pattern indicating current elevation.</p>
<p>When the target is visible the RIO commands full-action to acquire the target and transfer to pulse STT. If only half-action is commanded after entering into MRL and then released the radar transfers back to pulse search.</p>
<h3 id="tcs-slave-radar-acquisition"><a class="header" href="#tcs-slave-radar-acquisition">TCS Slave Radar Acquisition</a></h3>
<p>The TCS can be used to track a target in angle while still using the radar for range and rate. When selecting the radar to be slaved to the TCS line of sight via the sensor control panel (SLAVE in the RDR position) the radar will still be active but pointing in the direction of the TCS line of sight while the TCS has an active track instead of scanning.</p>
<p>From this state it is possible to command half-action and then position the acquisition gates at the target video and then command full-action. This will result in either pulse doppler slaved or pulse slaved mode depending on previous radar mode. It is also possible to switch using the P STT and PD STT button on the DDD panel.</p>
<p>The resulting submode entered is equivalent to an STT mode where the TCS is instead used to track the target's angle rather than the radar itself. The radar is still used to track range and rate, on the DDD the IROT lights instead of the ANT ROT, IROT relating to IR tracking which has been replaced by the TCS in the modeled F-14 versions.</p>
<p>This mode can be used to guide missiles, active and CW modes if in pulse and in PD if in pulse doppler. If the SLAVE switch is set to INDEP from this mode the system reverts to true pulse STT or pulse doppler STT depending on current mode.</p>
<h3 id="transition-between-the-two-stt-modes"><a class="header" href="#transition-between-the-two-stt-modes">Transition Between the Two STT Modes</a></h3>
<p>If necessary it is possible to transition between pulse STT and pulse doppler STT by pressing the corresponding button. If the transition fails the radar reverts to the respective search mode of the commanded STT mode (pulse search if pulse STT was selected and vice versa).</p>
<h3 id="transition-back-to-search"><a class="header" href="#transition-back-to-search">Transition Back to Search</a></h3>
<p>If the RIO wishes to transition back to a search mode he commands half-action and releases it causing the radar to return to pulse search if in pulse STT and pulse doppler search if in pulse doppler STT.</p>
<p>If the radar loses target lock in STT and cannot reacquire it reverts to the respective search mode as when the RIO transitions manually via half-action.</p>
<p>VSL and MRL can also be reset and returned to search the same way but PLM being prioritized means that the only way to deselect PLM is either target lockon and transition to pulse STT or the pilot selecting the PLM button again telling the radar to return to pulse search.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="anaxx-1-tcs-general-operation"><a class="header" href="#anaxx-1-tcs-general-operation">AN/AXX-1 TCS General Operation</a></h1>
<p><img src="systems/../img/tcs.png" alt="TCS" />
<em>U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s Mate Airman Justin S. Osborne. (030418-N-0382O-591)</em></p>
<p>The television camera set, or TCS, was constructed as a replacement for the IRST which was present in the first F-14As produced. When the IRST was found to have insufficient capability it was decided to replace it with the TCS giving the F-14 a long range visual identification capability.</p>
<p>The TCS is located underneath and behind the radar radome, just in front of the nose gear well. It contains an aircraft stabilized high resolution (for its time) closed circuit television camera. The sensor has two fields of view (FOV), narrow (NFOV) which is 0.44° or 10X magnification and wide (WFOV) which is 1.42° or 4X magnification. The gimbal limits are +/- 15° except upwards which is limited to +11° and the TCS is capable of independent contrast lock or being slaved to the AN/AWG-9 radar.</p>
<p>The TCS is controlled by the RIO using the sensor control panel, DDD, TID and the HCU. Video from the sensor can be displayed on the TID and the VDI in the front seat. Also, the video can be recorded using the airborne video tape recorder for later review. (Not currently implemented in DCS.)</p>
<h2 id="tcs-controls-and-symbology"><a class="header" href="#tcs-controls-and-symbology">TCS Controls and Symbology</a></h2>
<p>The controls for the TCS are located in the RIO cockpit at the sensor control panel, the DDD and the HCU/TID. The pilot display control panel contains a switch allowing display of TCS video on the VDI.</p>
<h3 id="sensor-control-panel-2"><a class="header" href="#sensor-control-panel-2">Sensor Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/scp.png" alt="Sensor Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The controls on the sensor control panel for the TCS are; the TCS trim knobs, the SLAVE switch, the field of view, FOV, switch and the acquire, ACQ, switch.</p>
<p>The TCS TRIM knobs control TCS sensor line of sight, LOS, calibration relative to the AN/AWG-9 radar LOS. If needed these can be used to trim the TCS so that the two sensors LOS correlate. They have a ±2° range of motion and the easiest way to check and calibrate the TCS is to lock up a friendly target in STT and adjust the knobs until the TCS LOS is correctly aimed at the locked target.</p>
<p>The SLAVE switch controls which sensor is controlled by the other. If set to RDR the radar is slaved to the TCS as long as an optical track exists. If set to INDEP each sensor operates independently of the other. And if set to TCS the TCS is slaved to radar LOS as long as an STT track exists.</p>
<p>The FOV, field of view switch controls what FOV is used in the TCS. WIDE sets the 1.42°, 4X magnification FOV and NAR sets the narrow 0.44°, 10X magnification FOV.</p>
<p>Lastly the ACQ, acquire switch controls the acquisition mode in use in the TCS. AUTO SRCH enables an automatic acquisition mode with a search pattern, enabling acquisition of the closest target even if outside current FOV. MAN selects purely manual acquisition with the HCU where the target needs to be pointed at directly. AUTO sets an automatic acquisition mode without a search pattern making the TCS snap to a target as long as it’s inside the TCS FOV.</p>
<h3 id="ddd"><a class="header" href="#ddd">DDD</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/tcsddd.png" alt="DDD" /></p>
<p>The DDD contains two indicators pertaining to the TCS.</p>
<p>The DDD EL meter shows current elevation of the TCS sensor LOS as long as the IR/TV mode is selected on the HCU.</p>
<p>The IROT light indicates the presence of a TCS track. The IROT acronym is inherited from the IRST which the TCS replaced.</p>
<h3 id="hcutid"><a class="header" href="#hcutid">HCU/TID</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/hcu2.png" alt="HCU/TID" /></p>
<p>The HCU contains the power switch and indicator for the TCS as well as a button enabling selection for using the HCU to control the TCS while the TID itself has a control knob enabling display of the TCS video on the TID as well as a brightness and contrast control for the video on the TID.</p>
<p>The IR/TV power switch is located on the top left corner on the HCU panel and controls power to the TCS. OFF disables all power to the TCS. STBY enables power to the cooling fans and heaters in the TCS. IR/TV supplies power to all systems in the TCS, allow 1-2 minutes for the TCS to spin up and deliver video. TCS symbology on the TID on the other hand will be available directly. There is also no need to select the STBY position first, setting the switch to IR/TV directly works fine.</p>
<p>The indication light next to the power switch indicates a TCS over temperature condition is lit. If present the TCS should be powered off to prevent damage to the system.</p>
<p>The IR/TV button next to the HCU stick enables HCU stick control of the TCS sensor, half-action to manually control sensor LOS and full-action to command target acquisition.</p>
<p>On the TID display control the TID MODE switch set to TV enables display of the TCS video on the TID. Note that this disables the TID repeat on the HSD.</p>
<p>Finally, the CONTRAST and BRIGHTNESS knobs on the upper part of the TID can be used to control the TCS video shown on the TID.</p>
<h3 id="symbology"><a class="header" href="#symbology">Symbology</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/symbology.png" alt="Symbology" /></p>
<p>On the TID in non TV mode, a TCS track is indicated by a 1.5” strobe at TCS LOS azimuth with a hollow circle at the end.</p>
<p>The symbology on the video feed from the TCS has indicators for the FOV and two crosshairs indicating TCS LOS relative own aircraft, GACH, and AN/AWG-9 radar LOS relative TCS LOS, RACH. Additionally, the track window is indicated by 4 small squares representing each corner of that window.</p>
<p>The field of view lines are shown when in the wide FOV indicating the size of the area visible when switching to the narrow FOV. They consist of two parallel lines together creating the sides of an imaginary box indicating the narrow FOV size.</p>
<p>The gimbal angle crosshairs or GACH, which is a solid cross, indicate deflection of the TCS LOS from the aircraft datum line, ADL. GACH crosshair in center indicates TCS LOS along ADL and deflection towards the edges indicate deflection towards the gimbal limits with the video edges being maximum deflection.</p>
<p>RACH or radar angle crosshairs, a dashed crosshair, indicate radar antenna LOS when inside the current TCS FOV. When the sensors are slaved to one another RACH and GACH will coincide creating a single solid crosshair.</p>
<p>The track window indicates the area that the TCS contrast tracker is currently locked on to if it has acquired a target. When not in an active track these squares collapse into the center of the display being 2% of the screen width when in manual mode and 5% when in an auto mode.</p>
<h2 id="tcs-operation"><a class="header" href="#tcs-operation">TCS Operation</a></h2>
<p>All acquisition modes of the TCS have in common that they can be controlled using the HCU in IR/TV mode. Selection of the IR/TV button on the HCU enables this mode and also sets the DDD EL meter (right indicator) to show current TCS sensor LOS elevation. Half-action enables the HCU to directly control the LOS of the TCS and full-action commands target acquisition using the selected acquisition mode.</p>
<p>For manual, MAN, TCS acquisition mode this means that the HCU must be used in half-action to position the tracking window indication over the target and then selecting full-action. If successfully acquired the track window will then expand to encompass the target and tracking will begin.</p>
<p>In automatic, AUTO acquisition mode half-action works the same but when selecting full-action for acquisition the TCS will instead automatically try to lock on to the target closest to the center in the current FOV. Automatic search, AUTO SRCH mode further enhances this by enabling a search pattern around the commanded FOV (by moving the sensor LOS) acquiring the first found target.</p>
<p>When using the TCS slave to radar option the two auto modes will automatically try to lock on to the STT target as soon as it exists and the TCS has been slewed to that target, enabling a fully automatic track of a target locked in STT. Additionally, as soon as a track is acquired from an STT lock the TCS will compare its own LOS to the radar LOS to check if the correct target has been locked, if the two LOS differ by more than a couple of degrees during a 3-second window a new acquisition will be attempted. The manual mode will also slave to radar LOS but will not lock on, instead just following the radar LOS.</p>
<p>To unlock a tracked target when not being slaved to radar, select half-action and release.</p>

<p>The Multiple Weapons System is designed to provide a single point of management
for all stores deliverable by the F-4 with regards to arming, pylon activation,
delivery mode, and selective jettison. While specific weapons may have
additional controls elsewhere in the cockpit on a case by case basis, all of the

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_nose_tail_arming.jpg" alt="pilot_nose_tail_arm" /></p>
<p>Beginning from the top of the panel, the four way Nose/Tail ARM switch selects
the solenoids for arming wire capture on MERs and TERs, which then arm the fuzes
at the point of release. Additionally, the switch position can also dictate
in-flight high/low drag release mode for retarded bombs such as the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/conventional_bombs.html">Mk 82
Snakeye</a>.</p>

<p>MER-10 and TER-9 racks include an automatic stepper mode function to
automatically bypass stations that have already released munitions. To set this
function, when the BOMBS mode of the Weapon Select Knob is chosen, the Nose/Tail
switch must be in the NOSE or the NOSE &amp; TAIL position for release signals to be
delivered through installed MERs and TERs and bypass empty positions; if the
system is set in TAIL, an additional release pulse(s) must be applied using the
bomb switch to cycle through the empty stations. Usage of the MER-10A and TER-9A
circumvent this requirement.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aircraft-weapons-release-unit-awru"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-weapons-release-unit-awru">Aircraft Weapons Release Unit (AWRU)</a></h1>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_awru.jpg" alt="pilot_awru" /></p>
<p>Used in the BOMBS and RKTS &amp; DISP weapon modes, the AWRU provides interval and
quantity controls for munition delivery. The AWRU has both a manual and
automatic mode, and the resulting function is accessed with the appropriate
settings.</p>
<p>The Interval Knob contains 14 values, providing base interval timing of release
pulses while the bomb release button is held from 1/20th of a second (.05) to 1
second. This value can have a 10x multiplier applied to it using the INTRVL
Switch. In the NORM mode of the INTRVL switch, the release will apply as on the
Interval Knob, whereas when selected to x10, the 10x multiplier will apply - for
example, 1 second in NORM would become an interval of 10 seconds in x10 mode.</p>
<p>The Quantity Knob sets the total number of munitions dropped during a bomb
release hold, and applies the manual or automatic release functions based on the
value selected.</p>
<h2 id="single-manual-1"><a class="header" href="#single-manual-1">Single-Manual: 1</a></h2>
<p>In the 1 position, the AWRU is placed into manual mode. One munition will be
dropped on each bomb release press, with releases across multiple selected
stations dropping in a left-right-left pattern. The bomb release button must be
released, then pressed a subsequent time, to release another round.</p>
<h2 id="single-ripple-2-18"><a class="header" href="#single-ripple-2-18">Single-Ripple: 2-18</a></h2>
<p>In numerical positions 2-18, up to the total number of selected munitions will
be dropped according to the Interval setting. As an example, with a QTY of 6 and
an interval of .20, six bombs will be dropped, one every 2/10ths of a second
from the press of the bomb release button. The sequence will reset upon button
release, allowing subsequent ripples of the same quantity to be dropped.</p>
<h2 id="single-continuous-c"><a class="header" href="#single-continuous-c">Single-Continuous: C</a></h2>
<p>In position C, the quantity of weapons is dictated by how long the bomb release
button is held. The ripple will apply the set interval, releasing one munition
each pulse, until the bomb button is released.</p>
<h2 id="pairs-manual-p"><a class="header" href="#pairs-manual-p">Pairs-Manual: P</a></h2>
<p>Position P places the AWRU into pairs mode. With multiple stations selected,
each time the bomb button is pressed, a weapon will be released from each
station.</p>
<h2 id="salvo-s"><a class="header" href="#salvo-s">Salvo: S</a></h2>
<p>In the S position, the AWRU enters into salvo mode, functioning like
Pairs-Manual with single rounds released from each station, but using the set
interval value to release multiple salvos until the bomb button is released.</p>

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/ext_f4_wrcs.jpg" alt="ext_bombs_dropping" /></p>
<p>Provision for the F-4E to perform accurate level and dive munition delivery is
provided by the AN/ASQ-91 WRCS. The WRCS inputs are set with the associated
panels in the cockpits, and these commands, along with INS data and radar target
ranging, are used by the ballistic computer to provide the release signal.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_wrcs_panel.jpg" alt="wso_wrcs_panel" /></p>
<h2 id="target-range-controls"><a class="header" href="#target-range-controls">Target Range Controls</a></h2>
<p>The Computer Control Panel found in the rear cockpit has three TARGET entry
controls, two RELEASE entries, and a bomb DRAG COEFFICIENT entry setting, as
well as a <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../procedures/bit_tests/wrcs.html">BIT</a> control knob for system function check. Target
entry is relative to the predetermined IP.</p>
<p>The upper range control input is for North/South, and selection of relative
bearing is noted by the N or S prefix at the start.</p>
<p>The middle range control input is for East/West, and like the previous, the E or
W prefix on the range sets the relative bearing direction.</p>
<p>The final ALT RANGE entry is for target altitude- whether the target or RIP
(Radar Identification Point) elevation as MSL, or the target/RIP's pressure
altitude. In Laydown mode the entry refers to the distance between the IP and
the target in hundreds of feet.</p>
<p>Entries for North/South and East/West are in 100 foot increments, and a maximum
value of up to 99,900 feet may be entered for these distances. The ALT RANGE
entry has a maximum of 24,900 in 100 foot increments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The WRCS can be damaged if the ALT RANGE entry is greater
than the aircraft's current MSL (x100) in TGT FIND and OFFSET BOMB modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="release-range-control"><a class="header" href="#release-range-control">Release Range Control</a></h2>
<p>The Release Range control is used to manually set bomb range in tens of feet,
and is accessible in the Laydown, Dive Laydown, and Offset Bombing modes. The
maximum setting is 9990 feet (999x10), and when used in a WRCS/AJB-7 integrated
delivery, the actual range can be as high as 99,900'.</p>
<p>The Rg control should not be set to the same value as the target range control.
Otherwise, the bomb rack delay may release late, or not at all.</p>
<h2 id="release-advance-control"><a class="header" href="#release-advance-control">Release Advance Control</a></h2>
<p>Operative in all WRCS and WRCS/LABS integrated motes, the Release Advance
Control works in conjunction with the AWRU to advance the release signal in
milliseconds. Whereas the AWRU Intervalometer setting triggers the release pulse
sequence from the moment the bomb release button is pressed, when the Release
Advance Control is applied in a WRCS driven delivery, the specific bomb location
in a multiple ripple sequence can be calculated in advance, allowing the most
effective spread possible across a given target.</p>
<p>As an example, an AWRU single-ripple quantity release of 4 is selected with an
interval of 120 milliseconds. To place the third bomb in the ripple on target,
the following equation is used:</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/release_advance_formula.jpg" alt="Release Advance Formula" /></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RA</code> = Release Advance Setting, milliseconds</li>
<li><code>I_R</code> = AWRU Release Intervalometer setting, milliseconds</li>
<li><code>N_Tgt</code> = Impact Sequence number of bomb desired on target</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/release_advance_formula_example.jpg" alt="Release Advance Formula" /></p>
<p>Thus, for this release, we would set the value of RA to 240 msec. This would
produce a spread of two bombs ahead of target, one on the calculated target
point, and one behind.</p>
<p>The maximum setting for the Release Advance Control is 999 milliseconds. A calculator to calculate
the Release advance in-game is provided with
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing
<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> in game.</p>
<h2 id="drag-coefficient-control"><a class="header" href="#drag-coefficient-control">Drag Coefficient Control</a></h2>
<p>Used only in the Dive Toss Mode, this entry is a bias factor prepared for the
ballistic computer to compensate for actual bomb trajectory. The maximum setting
for this value is 9.99.</p>
<h3 id="ballistic-computer"><a class="header" href="#ballistic-computer">Ballistic Computer</a></h3>
<p>The ballistic computer is not directly accessed by the flight crew, but instead
pre-set based on the configured loadout by the ground crew to add the necessary
ejection bias factors. The computer uses these pre-set bias factors in
conjunction with a coefficient setting for munition drag in the Dive Toss mode to
calculate accurate delivery.</p>
<h2 id="wrcs-built-in-test-bit"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-built-in-test-bit">WRCS Built-In-Test (BIT)</a></h2>
<p>The BIT control is used to confirm go/no-go status of the WRCS. The BIT system
checks individual bomb modes individually, and effectivity of the given setting
is confirmed by selecting the desired mode, pushing the center of the knob PUSH
FOR BIT for five seconds, then pressing the FREEZE button in conjunction with the
PUSH FOR BIT button. Confirmation of mode performance will be displayed as GO or
NO-GO. Should a mode be checked a subsequent time during a flight and a NO-GO
response is received, it can be disregarded.</p>
<h2 id="cursor-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#cursor-control-panel">Cursor Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_cursor_control_panel.jpg" alt="wso_cursor_control_panel" /></p>
<p>The Cursor Control Panel provides the controls needed for TARGET FIND and OFFSET
bombing modes. The panel has two wheels named ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK,
which is used in the MAP-PPI mode to position their respective cursors over the
Radar Identification Point (from this point denoted as RIP). The ALONG TRACK
control, which presents relative range to the RIP, also includes an internal
switch enabling the cursor instructions to be acknowledged by the WRCS ballistic
computer, and must therefore be the first applied command in the target
insertion sequence.</p>
<p>Once the ALONG TRACK (range hemisphere) and CROSS TRACK (vertical line) cursors
are aligned over the RIP, the FREEZE button is pressed to initiate WRCS ground
path tracking of the specified point. The button remains illuminated until the
RESET button is pressed or another bombing mode is selected.</p>
<p>With WRCS ground tracking initiated, the TARGET INSERT button is pressed for the
ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors to shift from the RIP to the offset target.
Once selected, target steering information is provided from the WRCS to the
BDHI, ADI, HSI, and optical sight. In the AGM-45 missile mode, the AoA Indexers
will provide maneuver commands for level, dive, or climb requirements to align
for seeker acquisition. Further, unless the Pull up tone switch is disabled on the
LABS panel, an audio tone will be triggered from the point of bomb release
button press until the first bomb releases from the aircraft; this function is
nominally for training purposes, as it can preclude other system audio volume.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-delivery-panel"><a class="header" href="#weapon-delivery-panel">Weapon Delivery Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_weapon_delivery_panel.jpg" alt="wso_weapon_delivery_panel" /></p>
<p>The Weapon Delivery Panel permits the aircrew to use the WRCS TGT FIND functions
in LABS (ARBCS) modes - those found on the left side of the pilot's Delivery Mode
Knob.</p>
<p>The TGT FIND switch on the panel functions the same as the TGT FIND mode on the
Delivery Mode Knob. The Delivery Mode Knob overrides this switch in any mode
outside of TGT FIND, and should be set back to NORM. The HOLD position energizes
the target finding circuits in conjunction with any LABS or DIRECT mode the pilot
selects.</p>
<p>The RANGE Switch is functional in any WRCS mode requiring a Release Range
setting. The NORM position applies the noted x10 multiplier on the displayed
Release setting, whereas selecting x100 applies a multiplier of 100 to the
counter value.</p>
<p>The ACTIVATE Switch triggers the prerequisite activation signals to the LABS
circuits once the aircraft has passed within the Release Range. The switch
should only be placed in ON after target insert has been pressed and the ALONG
TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors have transitioned to the target.</p>

pitch-relative bombing. Interfacing with the Multiple Weapon Controls, Pedestal
Panel weapon settings, and bomb, laser guided, or the AGM-45, the system
releases the selected munition once the respective Bombing Timer or respective
Bomb Release Angle Computer pitch angle (gyro) target has been achieved.</p>
<p>The left side of the Delivery Mode Knob selects the ARBCS release modes. Both
LOFT and T LAD modes provide weapons release in a pull-up, with LOFT selecting a
4.0 G pull-up schedule and weapon release on achieving a set gyro angle value,
whereas T LAD assumes a 3.5 G pull-up schedule and release at the end of the
Bombing Timer setting. Necessary values for Low and High angle, as well as the
Bombing Timer are found on the provided tables.</p>
<h2 id="bomb-release-angle-computer"><a class="header" href="#bomb-release-angle-computer">Bomb Release Angle Computer</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_release_angle.jpg" alt="wso_bomb_release_angle" /></p>
<p>The Bomb Release Angle Computer provides entry of the necessary target pitch
angles for ARBCS bombing modes. The values of HIGH (70 to 179.9 degrees) and LOW
(0 to 89.9 degrees) are controlled using their respective entry knobs.
Internally, the computer contains the release switches, as well as the resolver
to transmit the target angle values to the ADI director pointers.</p>
<p>A calculator for the input values in-game is provided by
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing
<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> in game.</p>

<h2 id="bombing-timers"><a class="header" href="#bombing-timers">Bombing Timers</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_bombing_timer.jpg" alt="wso_bomb_release_timer" /></p>
<p>Timers for ARBCS bombing modes are available for PULL-UP (0 to 60 seconds) and
RELEASE (0 to 30 seconds). Both can be set in increments of 0.1 second, with 0.1
second as the minimum setting. The reference windows do not count down during
the bomb run.</p>
<p>When the PULL-UP timer is complete, required PULL-UP signaling will initiate,
along with any ADI director programming to show proper flight path. RELEASE
timing is mode dependent, and will occur once PULL-UP is complete, if required.</p>
<p>In LOFT and O/S modes, only PULL-UP timing is activated, and a value must be set
to energize the ADI pull-up flight path program.</p>
<p>In T LAD and TL, PULL-UP and RELEASE are both activated, in sequence, and both
require a value entry- PULL-UP to energize the flight path programming, and
RELEASE to generate the munition release signal.</p>
<p>In integrated LABS (ARBCS)/WRCS bombing, the above requirements are the same;
however, the WRCS initiates the bomb run timing, rather than pressing the bomb
button. When the WRCS initiates timing, an audio tone is applied to signal timer
start.</p>
<p>A calculator for the input values in-game is provided by
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing
<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> in game.</p>
<h2 id="arbcs-indicators"><a class="header" href="#arbcs-indicators">ARBCS Indicators</a></h2>
<p>During ARBCS weapons delivery, a number of indicators are available to confirm
run initiation and at what step of the given run the aircraft is in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon run initiation (bomb button press/WRCS initiation) and PULL-UP timer
start, the Pull-up light turns ON.
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_pull_up_light.jpg" alt="pilot_pull_up_timer" /></li>
<li>At PULL-UP timer completion, the Pull-up light turns OFF, the reticle light
turns OFF, and a steady Pull-up Tone (if switched ON) occurs.</li>
<li>As release pitch angle is attained, the Pull-up light turns ON, the reticle
light turns ON, and the Pull-up Tone stops.</li>
<li>When the bomb button is released, Pull-up light turns OFF.</li>
</ol>
<p>This indication sequence can occur with the master arm in SAFE for training
purposes.</p>

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_fast_erect.jpg" alt="pilot_gyro_fast_erect" /></p>
<p>Due to rapid maneuvering during a bombing run, gyro deviation can occur due to
fluid migration. While this deviation will resolve naturally at a rate of 1 to 2
degrees correction per minute over time, it can quickly be corrected by using the
FAST ERECT switch found in the front pilot cockpit on the left side console, at
a rate of 15 degrees per minute. This switch should not be held for more than 60
seconds, or damage can occur to the gyro.</p>

<p>The shutter control lever is a two position lever with positions of CL (closed) and OPEN.
In the CL

<h2 id="reticle-image"><a class="header" href="#reticle-image">Reticle Image</a></h2>
<p>The reticle image that is projected onto the combining glass is composed of a fixed
reticle, roll
reference tabs, and a range bar. The fixed reticle consists of 2-mil diameter pipper
located in the
center of a 25-mil diameter segmented circle, and a 50-mil diameter completed circle.</p>
<p>The roll reference tabs rotate about the 50-mil circle. The roll reference tabs have two
seperate functions. During the offset bombing mode and the target finding mode the roll
tabs provide steering information from the WRCS. The position of the roll tabs, with
respect to the fixed index tabs, indicates the angle between the ground track and course
to the target. In every other mode of operation the roll tabs indicate the aircraft roll
attitude, supplied by the INS.</p>

<p>The range bar is semicircular and appears on the inside of
the 50-mil circle only when a target has been acquired by radar lockon. The instantaneous
length of the range bar, and the rate at which the length is changing indicates the actual
radar slant range and the range between the aircraft and the target. The minimum length of
the range bar (and minimum range indication) exists at the 6 o'clock position. With gun
selected the inside tab of the range bar at 6 o'clock, the actual radar range is 1000 ft.
At the 5 o'clock position the range bar is 2000ft continuing with 1000ft increments per
tab. The maximum range that can be shown is 6667ft with guns selected. When any other mode
than GUN is selected the range bar is 3000ft at the 6 o'clock position and 6000ft at the 5
o'clock position, with increments of 3000ft per tab. The maximum displayable range is then
20000ft.</p>

<p>The reticle cage function is applied through the CAGE button on the throttle. With the
sight operating in the (GUNS) A/A mode and with CAGE pressed (no radar lockon) the reticle

supplied to the computer but the range bar is not displayed. With radar lockon the
stiffening function is applied as long as CAGE is pressed. The range bar continues to

<h2 id="description"><a class="header" href="#description">Description</a></h2>
<p>The LANTIRN or Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night began life as combined targeting and navigation pods designed for the F-15E and F-16. When the US Navy became interested in using the F-14 Tomcat in the A/G role Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) began its own program to show that the LANTIRN could quickly be adapted for F-14 use.</p>
<p>As the pod was adapted for the F-14 the secondary navigational pod was deleted, keeping only the targeting pod. The pod was wired up to its own control panel as the F-14 didn’t have the required 1553-bus for complete integration. The control panel was patched into the TCS -&gt; TID video feed allowing it to select either the TCS or the LANTIRN for display on the TID and VDI.</p>
<p>While the pod can read waypoints and selected weapon from the WCS, the pod has its own GPS receiver and is otherwise self-contained and controlled only via its own control panel. Additionally, it also has its own weapons release guidance removing the need to boresight the pod to the aircraft, a time-consuming task.</p>
<p>The FLIR sensor itself has three different zoom levels or fields of view (FoV). The Wide FoV limits are 5.9° and allows a maximum slew rate of 8.5°/s. The Narrow FoV limits are 1.7° and allows a maximum slew rate of 1.8°/s. The last mode, the Expanded FoV is a digital zoom of the Narrow FoV, meaning that the resolution will be worse in this mode. The FoV limits for the Expanded FoV are 0.8° with a max slew rate of 0.7°/s.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-displays"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-displays">Controls and Displays</a></h2>
<p>All the controls for the LANTIRN are situated on its own control panel mounted on the RIO’s left side console when the pod is present, including the switch controlling what video feed the TID and VDI display in the TV mode.</p>
<h3 id="lantirn-video-elements"><a class="header" href="#lantirn-video-elements">LANTIRN Video Elements</a></h3>
<p>The FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed) video-feed from the LANTIRN has superimposed data readout for the crew’s use. This video-feed can be viewed both on the TID (in TV-mode) and on the VDI (also in TV-mode) when the FLIR feed is selected on the control panel.</p>
<p>Amongst other things the displays show own aircraft position, target position as well as targeting cues to the crew. When using the LANTIRN for A/G attack these readouts are also used as targeting and release cues.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/lantirn/../../img/FLIR.png" alt="FLIR" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Own aircraft data is shown in the upper left corner, showing position, altitude, groundspeed and pitch angle (dive).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pod displays whether it’s using white hot or black hot (WHOT and BHOT) as well as if the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) or MGC (Manual Gain Control) is in use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lower left datablock shows pod information, SR is slant range (line of sight range), AZ and EL is pod line of sight azimuth and elevation relative aircraft ADL (with AZ having L or R for left or right of aircraft heading). Below that is current UTC time and then IBIT codes below that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> IBIT codes are not implemented currently and the clock will show local time.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lower middle shows current pod mode (A/A or A/G) and track mode (AREA, POINT or Q designations) on the left side. The right side shows currently selected weapon and laser code while above and in the center an L is shown when the laser is armed and flashing when firing the laser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lower right shows data for currently selected Q (slewpoint) except for QSNO, QADL and QHUD, TTG being time to go until on top of currently selected Q, the rows below that, bearing and range to Q, ELEV indicating elevation in feet of Q and lastly, below that, Q location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crosshairs showing tracked position, in this case we have a bounding box, indicating currently tracked target in point mode. The two widest zoom modes will have boxes showing the field of view for the next, narrower, mode. Additionally there’s a small white square (FLIR pointing cue) moving around showing the current pod line of sight relative to aircraft from a top-down perspective. In this case it’s right next to the upside-down ^, top center, indicating that the pod is looking ahead of the aircraft. If the square is centered the pod is looking straight down and below center it indicates the pod looking aft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The steering guidance towards the selected Q, the top one being commanded heading and the vertical one on the right the bomb release cue.</p>
<ul>
<li>The commanded heading shows current aircraft heading above the inverted ^, with the commanded heading being displayed as a relative bearing either L (Left) or R (Right) of current aircraft heading below the line. The commanded heading is also indicated by a vertical line bisecting the horizontal one.</li>
<li>The right, bomb release cue, is only shown if the selected Q is QDES and shows a vertical line along which a release cue travels downwards. This release cue is only visible with a valid weapon selection (bomb) and when it reaches the two tick marks, that’s the cue to release. Below the line is the indicated TREL (Time to Release) in seconds, changing to TIMP (Time to Impact) after release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Around this all is the masking curve, indicating at what angles the pod will be masked by own aircraft (looking into the aircraft hull). This is relative to the FLIR pointing cue, when the cue moves outside the masking curve the sensor will be blocked by the hull.</p>
<h3 id="control-panel"><a class="header" href="#control-panel">Control Panel</a></h3>
<p>The control panel contains all the controls for the pod, including the control stick.</p>

<li>
<p>The LASER ARMED light illuminates when the laser is armed while the LASER switch arms it. (ARM and SAFE positions available.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Down right is the VIDEO switch which controls what video is fed to the TID and VDI, FLIR selecting LANTIRN FLIR video and TCS selecting TCS video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four grouped indicator lights indicate various error states in the LANTIRN system and the IBIT button initiates the IBIT (Initialized Built-In-Test).</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="control-stick-1"><a class="header" href="#control-stick-1">Control Stick</a></h3>
<p>The control stick for the LANTIRN operates the LANTIRN’s sensor itself, note though that the stick itself does not move, the buttons and hats on the stick are used to control the pod.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/lantirn/../../img/stick1.png" alt="Control Stick" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The left four-way hat, S3, allows selection of QWp- and QWp+ (left/right) in addition to Point Track (up) and Area Track (down) modes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The center slew hat is used to slew the sensor line of sight itself and depression of this hat switches between white hot (WHOT) and black hot (BHOT) sensor modes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right four-way hat, S4, allows for selection of QADL/QHUD (up), QDES (right) and QSNO (down) in addition to declutter level which is cycled by momentary depression of the hat. The left slider additionally changes the right hat function as detailed further down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The red button on top is used to cycle between the three fields of view (zoom levels) of the IR sensor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two-way hat on the side selects either the A/G or A/A modes of operation for the pod.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Located on the left side of the stick head is a two-way slider, spring-loaded to return to center. This switch changes the function of the right four-way hat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding it forwards allows for selection of manual gain while releasing and sliding it forwards again reselects automatic gain. Change of the manual gain with manual gain already selected can be done by sliding the switch forwards and holding it for 2 seconds. With this mode active up/down on the right hat increases and decreases the gain while left/right decreases and increases level.</li>
<li>Sliding the switch aft momentarily allows selection of used laser code, while sliding it aft and holding allows for focus control. When set to laser code change, the right four-way hat selects digit to change with left/right and increases and decreases the selected digit with up/down. In focus control up/down increases and decreases focus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Located on the front of the stick is a two-stage trigger, first detent manually lasing while the second detent fires the laser and designates QDES at current sensor position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly on the front side of the stick is the latched laser fire button. Selecting it fires the laser for 60 seconds which can be overridden by pressing and releasing the first trigger detent. A renewed press on the laser latch button resets the latched laser fire timer to 60 seconds, beginning a new 60-second countdown.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="operation-1"><a class="header" href="#operation-1">Operation</a></h2>
<h3 id="startup"><a class="header" href="#startup">Startup</a></h3>
<p>To start the LANTIRN from cold, set the power switch to POD. This will start the LANTIRN power-up sequence which takes 8 minutes. When ready, this will be indicated by the MODE switch showing STBY.</p>
<p>When at STBY, depression of the MODE button switches the system to OPER (Operational), enabling the LANTIRN sensor after a 30-second initialization.</p>
<p>Lastly, to allow display of LANTIRN FLIR video, select FLIR on the VIDEO switch.</p>
<h3 id="sensor-modes-and-operation"><a class="header" href="#sensor-modes-and-operation">Sensor Modes and Operation</a></h3>
<p>The LANTIRN has two “master” modes, A/A and A/G. Both work similarly but are optimized for different types of targets. Additionally, the A/G mode allows for bomb release guidance.</p>
<p>The pod has two main ways of controlling the sensor line of sight, either via contrast lock (image following) or via being slaved to a Q designation.</p>
<p>The Area and Point Track modes are the two contrast lock modes in which the LANTIRN locks onto contrast differences in the LANTIRN FLIR video itself. This in itself only allows for angle tracking which gives imprecise ranging using own aircraft position and pod line of sight to calculate target position. It does however allow the system to track moving targets.</p>
<p>The last tracking mode has the sensor slewed to a stored location/direction, called a Q. The directional Qs do not allow for guidance to a location while the location Qs do.</p>
<p>QSNO and QADL/QHUD are directional. QSNO slaves the sensor to the ground 15 NM directly in front of the aircraft along own aircraft heading. QADL and QHUD slave the sensor to either ADL (in A/A) or the aircraft wings symbol on the HUD (in A/G).</p>
<p>The location Qs have two sources, QWp- and QWp+ on the stick’s left hat can be used to cycle through the WCS waypoints, allowing the RIO to slew to the different waypoints for navigation and target localization.</p>
<p>The other source is via pod designation. By selecting the second detent on the LANTIRN trigger the current sensor track or location is lased and a new location stored using that data. This is called the QDES and is used to designate targets for engagement as well as allowing the RIO to select a new location for navigational reference on the fly. The QDES can not however be automatically transferred to the WCS, but the RIO can enter it manually using the target location information in the pod video feed.</p>
<p>The lower right datablock is enabled for the location Qs only but will remain even when the pod is slewed away in area or point track modes. As soon as another Q is selected however, it will update to that location instead or be removed if a directional Q is selected.</p>
<h3 id="ag-target-engagement-and-designation"><a class="header" href="#ag-target-engagement-and-designation">A/G Target Engagement and Designation</a></h3>
<p>The LANTIRN steering cues for ground target engagement are automatically enabled when the LANTIRN is slewed to QDES or a new QDES is designated. The QDES itself will remain even if a new Q is selected and as long as it exists, the steering cues will point towards QDES even if slewed to another point. This is important to keep in mind as it is easy to think that the steering commands are to the current sensor location instead of the QDES.</p>
<p>The laser designation itself can however point to a different location than the QDES as the laser always points to the current track. This can be used to quickly change back to a target marked by the QDES if desired and when lasing a moving target a QDES should be set at an estimated target location at impact (estimated manually) and then the point track mode or manual slew can be used to designate the actual target more precisely.</p>
<p>To change laser code, move the stick left side slider aft and release, this will change right hat (S4) into laser code mode. The currently selected digit will blink and the S4 hat can then be used to set the digits. Left/right change what digit to set and up/down change the value of the digit. Renewed selection of aft on the left slider will then exit the laser code mode.</p>
<p>If the right, S4, hat is depressed while in laser mode the automatic lase mode will be enabled, indicated by the M (for manual) left of the digits changing to an A (autolase). Repeat to switch back to manual mode. While activated, the autolase mode will begin firing the laser at 10 seconds TIMP until TIMP zero +4 seconds.</p>
<p>The bomb release cue is only visible with a valid weapon (bomb) selected and the selected bomb is read from the weapon selector wheel on the RIO armament panel via the WCS. The actual bomb release can be accomplished using the computer pilot or computer target modes but the manual mode is recommended. In manual mode the pilot follows the cues in the LANTIRN video feed on the VDI and releases the bomb when cued by the LANTIRN.</p>

<h2 id="description-1"><a class="header" href="#description-1">Description</a></h2>
<p>The AN/ALE-39 is the countermeasures dispensing set installed in the F-14 in this simulation. It controls its own set of launchers located between the engine nozzles on the underside of the so-called beaver-tail.</p>
<p>The launchers each have two sections, one containing 10 cartridges and the other 20. They are referred to the left and right dispensers even though the left is really the front one and the right the back one with both being mounted in line on the left side of the tailhook. This is a remnant from the earliest model F-14s carrying the AN/ALE-29.</p>
<p>This all sums up to a capacity of 60 cartridges in the system with each section necessarily holding one type of cartridge meaning that any combination of cartridges is possible as long as each type’s quantity is a multiple of 10. The system itself has no real knowledge of what is loaded where so incorrectly programming the system can lead to the wrong type of cartridge being ejected.</p>
<p>The system itself can be operated manually from the control panel in the RIO pit or the DLC thumbwheel on the pilot stick when the flaps lever is in the up position. It is also capable of running programmed sequences of ejection which in turn can be initiated manually by the RIO from the control panel or the direction hats mounted on the hand hold over the DDD. In addition, the AN/ALR-67 can also initiate the chaff ejection program if set up correctly on the AN/ALE-39 control panel.</p>
<h2 id="controls-and-operation"><a class="header" href="#controls-and-operation">Controls and Operation</a></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In DCS the F-14 countermeasure loadout is set in the Mission Editor, see DCS Mission Editor Functions Specific to the HB DCS F-14 or controlled through the radio menu under ground crew. The default setting in the mission editor is bypassed. To see the real loadout check the kneeboard.</p>
<h3 id="programmer"><a class="header" href="#programmer">Programmer</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/countermeasures/../../../../img/programmer.png" alt="Programmer" /></p>
<p>The programmer is used to set up what countermeasure cartridges are loaded where and to set up the different ejection programs. The panel is located on the right horizontal console of the RIO cockpit.</p>
<p>The left side of the programmer holds the controls (thumbwheels) for the different ejection programs, one section for each type of cartridge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CHAFF section:</strong> Controls how to eject chaff in program mode. The chaff sequences are programmed to launch a number of salvos, each consisting of a burst of a set amount of cartridges.
<ul>
<li><strong>B QTY:</strong> Controls how many cartridges to eject in each burst, selection of 1-4 cartridges and C for continuous and R for random (4-6 cartridges) possible.</li>
<li><strong>B INTV:</strong> Sets the time in seconds between each individual cartridge ejection in each burst, possible settings being .1 (0.125), .2 (0.25), .5 (0.5), .7 (0.75), 1 and R for random.</li>
<li><strong>S QTY:</strong> Controls how many salvos of bursts to eject in each program, settings available are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15.</li>
<li><strong>S INT:</strong> Sets the time in seconds between each salvo in the program, available settings are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the random and continuous settings for B, special conditions apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>B at C QTY and R INTV:</strong> Sets the first 3 cartridges to launch at 0.125-second intervals, the rest at random intervals from 0.25 to 4 seconds. Ejection disregards the S settings and continues until all cartridges are ejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B at R QTY and R INTV:</strong> Sets each burst to have between 4-6 cartridges and to eject at random intervals between 0.25 to 4 seconds. The first burst in a salvo will always launch the first 3 cartridges at 0.125-second intervals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B at R QTY and INTV at set number:</strong> Sets each burst to launch between 4-6 cartridges at set interval. First burst will always launch first 3 cartridges at 0.125-second intervals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B at fixed QTY and R INTV:</strong> Sets each burst to eject one cartridge disregarding B QTY.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JAMMER section:</strong> Controls the ejection of jammer cartridges in programmed mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QTY:</strong> Sets how many jammer cartridges to eject, possible settings are 1-4.</li>
<li><strong>INTV:</strong> Uses all three indicated thumbwheels to set time in seconds between each ejection in the program. Settings from 1 to 299 possible in 1-second increments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Jammer cartridges not currently implemented in DCS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FLARE section:</strong> Controls ejection of flares when using programmed mode.
<ul>
<li><strong>QTY:</strong> Sets amount of flare cartridges to eject, possible settings being 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10.</li>
<li><strong>INTV:</strong> Sets time interval between each ejection in seconds, possible settings being 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The right side of the programmer sets the type of cartridge loaded into each section and the reset switch used after loading new cartridges.</p>
<p>The <strong>L10, L20, R10, and R20</strong> thumbwheels can be set to C, J, or F setting what cartridge is loaded into which section.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Incorrectly setting type of cartridge loaded can result in the launch of the wrong type of cartridge.</p>
<p>The <strong>RESET switch</strong> needs to be used to reset the system's internal counters after loading new cartridges into the launchers. Needs to be held to reset for at least 5 seconds to reset the system.</p>
<h3 id="control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#control-panel-1">Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/countermeasures/../../../img/controller.png" alt="Controller" /></p>
<p>The control panel is used to control system power, to set up automatic ejections, and to manually eject cartridges and is also located on the RIO right horizontal console.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>mechanical counters</strong> on the upper part of the panel are used to indicate remaining cartridges of each type. They need to be set up manually using the knob below each counter but decrease automatically as each cartridge ejection pulse is sent. As they’re set manually it’s possible to end up in a situation where the counter is at 0 but additional cartridges are still available. In these cases, ejection pulses will still be sent but the counter will remain at 0.</li>
<li>Below each counter, each cartridge type has a switch for manual ejection commands. The switches are momentary and spring-loaded to center, each having three positions. <strong>PRGM</strong> initiates the respective set ejection program, <strong>SGL</strong> commands ejection of a single cartridge of the respective type, and <strong>STBY</strong> is the default center position not commanding manual ejection.</li>
<li>The <strong>PWR/MODE switch</strong> enables power to the AN/ALE-39 and can enable automatic chaff launch via the AN/ALR-67 RWR.
<ul>
<li><strong>AUTO (CHAFF) / MAN:</strong> Enables power to the system and allows the AN/ALR-67 to initiate the set chaff ejection program but flares remain manual. Chaff ejection is initiated when the RWR detects a threat actively engaging own aircraft, after each program initiation a 30-second cooldown is present before the next program is initiated if such a detection is still present. Manual ejection is still available as normal.</li>
<li><strong>MAN:</strong> Enables power to the system and allows for manual initiation of all functions.</li>
<li><strong>OFF:</strong> Disables the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>FLARE MODE switch</strong> controls how flares are ejected and also sets up how the pilot stick DLC button is used. The flaps lever needs to be in the up position to enable DLC button cartridge ejection. The switch has three positions.
<ul>
<li><strong>MULT:</strong> Multiple, sets the system to eject one cartridge from each section set to flares on the programmer for each ejection pulse. Note that this means that if flares are loaded on all four sections this results in 4 flares being launched each time a flare ejection command is sent.</li>
<li><strong>NORM:</strong> Sets normal flare ejection pulse behavior.</li>
<li><strong>PILOT:</strong> Enables ejection of one flare cartridge with each depression of the DLC button. Normal flare ejection is still possible. If the switch is set to a position other than PILOT, the DLC button will command ejection of a single chaff cartridge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>SALVO FLARES switch</strong> initiates rapid ejection of all flares using a 0.125-second time interval. Normally spring-loaded to the OFF position. Can’t be stopped once initiated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All countermeasure cartridge ejection is inhibited while the weight on wheels sensor is active, preventing countermeasure ejection while on the ground.</p>
<h3 id="rio-hand-hold-switches"><a class="header" href="#rio-hand-hold-switches">RIO Hand Hold Switches</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/countermeasures/../../../img/cmhats1.png" alt="CM Hats" /></p>
<p>Two four-way direction hats are mounted on the RIO hand hold above the DDD to enable quick access to countermeasure ejection. The two switches are mirrored and UP commands ejection of a single chaff cartridge. DOWN initiates the chaff ejection program, INBOARD (towards center) initiates the jammer ejection program, and OUTBOARD (towards the sides) initiates the flare ejection program.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lau-138"><a class="header" href="#lau-138">LAU-138</a></h1>
<p>The LAU-138 chaff dispenser was developed to meet the need for additional chaff cartridge payload capacity. The launcher itself was developed in Sweden by CelsiusTech as a chaff dispenser integrated into a rail designed to replace the LAU-7 Sidewinder rail. Each rail holds up to 160 chaff packages, each being smaller than a normal chaff cartridge while still enabling the mounting of a single AIM-9 Sidewinder to itself.</p>
<p>On the F-14 the LAU-138 was used mounted on the 1A and 8A stations. While technically able to be mounted on the respective B stations as well, it wasn’t possible to refill the launcher while mounted there so wasn’t used there operationally.</p>
<p>While having the LAU-138s mounted, the R10 and R20 sections in the launcher are both connected to the R20 section and the R10 connected to the LAU-138s. This means that the R20 section type setting on the programmer controls both R10 and R20 and the R10 section type setting should always be set to C for chaff.</p>
<p>Each launcher holds, as mentioned, 160 chaff packages and each ejection impulse ejects four packages from each launcher, each package being about 1/4 the size of a normal chaff cartridge. This results in that each ejection impulse ejects the equivalent of two chaff cartridges in total and that a total of 40 ejections are available from the launchers.</p>
<p>As the launchers use the R10 section of the programmer, mounting two LAU-138s results means that the counter for chaff on the controller should be increased by 40. A chaff only loadout can result in the number of launches available to be in total 100, which is too much for the counter, and that the counter will effectively show one chaff ejection less than what’s really available. The last ejection will still work though.</p>
<p>In summary, this means that when using the LAU-138 an additional 40 chaff ejections are available increasing the total number to anywhere from 100 chaff to 40 chaff and 60 flares when combined with the normal AN/ALE-39 loadout and that the R10 section should always be set to C for chaff when mounted.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="radar-warning-receiver"><a class="header" href="#radar-warning-receiver">Radar warning receiver</a></h1>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_happy_face.jpg" alt="rwr_happy_face" /></p>
<p>The ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver (subsequently RWR) is the F-4E's passive
situational awareness system for detection of airborne and surface-to-air radar
threats. The system captures signals from multiple pairs of directional antennas
installed at the aft of the fuselage, on each wingtip and under the nose; the
difference in relative timing of detection and angle by the antennas is used by
the system to define a relative bearing to the emitting radar. Further
processing of the received radiation references the stored threat catalog to
ascertain emitter type, as well as to define a relative threat range as a
function of received power versus known output.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_with_contacts.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_with_contacts" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚧 The ALR-46 is currently installed in the housing of a APR-36 earlier RWR model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting processed threat signal is then presented on the RWR's CRT display, with bearing to
the emitter shown on the display with the top relative to the nose (12 o'clock) and the bottom the
tail (6 o'clock), and with proximity to center relative to the system's calculation of the level of
threat - with closer indications being of higher danger, and those within the middle ring being
classified within engagement range. In normal operation, the ALR-46 can present 16 threats on the
CRT concurrently. The highest priority threat as computed by the ALR-46's threat and range catalog
is presented on the display with a diamond superimposed by its symbol; this is considered "floating"
diamond functionality, with the ALR-46 defining priority. In the event of possible engagement by a
threat emitter (concurrent with the illumination of the ACTIVITY and/or MISSILE LAUNCH buttons), the
event is signified by a circle around the emitter symbol.</p>
<h2 id="alr-46-controls"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-controls">ALR-46 Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/wso_rwr_control_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_control_panel" /></p>
<p>Controls are duplicated for pilot and WSO. The pilot controls are
directly below the RWR Indicator, while the controls for the WSO are found
below the Central Indicator in the front of the view.</p>
<h3 id="rwr-display-intensity-knob"><a class="header" href="#rwr-display-intensity-knob">RWR Display Intensity Knob</a></h3>
<p>Found adjacent to the RWR situation display in the lower left corner of the panel, the Intensity
Knob functions as a dimmer to control the brightness of the displayed RWR returns. Clockwise raises
the brightness, counter-clockwise lowers the brightness.</p>
<h3 id="alr-46-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-control-panel">ALR-46 Control Panel</a></h3>
<p>The ALR-46 Control Panel consists of ten multipurpose, illuminated buttons, along with a pair of
rotary knobs for controlling the system's volume and panel brightness.</p>
<h3 id="priorityopen"><a class="header" href="#priorityopen">Priority/Open</a></h3>
<p>The ALR-46 defaults on power-up to OPEN mode (<num>1</num>), which presents up to 16 threats on the
display atone time, depending on how many emitters are visible and current system settings (Search,
LOW ALT, etc.). In the event the crew requires immediate prioritization of the most pressing threats
in a saturated environment, the PRIORITY button can be pressed to display the five emitters the
system deems the most dangerous. When pressed, the OPEN illumination will swap to the PRIORITY
position, and revert back upon selection back to OPEN.</p>
<h3 id="s-search"><a class="header" href="#s-search">S (Search)</a></h3>
<p>By default, the ALR-46 is programmed to prioritize and display emitters tied to weapons that can
engage and destroy the aircraft. However, missions will require monitoring of early warning and
search radar systems working with longer pulse-widths for extended range detection and tracking of
possible intruders - i.e., the F-4. These emitters can be displayed using the Search mode
(<num>2</num>), which
presents them on the RWR with the S symbol to signify their function as a long range search radar.
Entry into Search mode is displayed on the button with an illuminated "S".</p>
<p>Because of their low threat priority, it is important to note that search radar symbology may often
fall off the display due to their reduced importance - especially when the ALR-46 is placed into
PRIORITY mode.</p>
<h3 id="handoff-h-with--diamond"><a class="header" href="#handoff-h-with--diamond">Handoff (H with &lt;&gt; Diamond)</a></h3>
<p>The Handoff button (<num>3</num>) provides the opportunity for the flight crew to define the
priority emitting
threat. By default, the ALR-46 defines the highest priority threat as a function of range, current
transmitting mode, and the threat catalog. This priority threat is visualized with a diamond
superimposed around the emitter's symbol. In the event the pilot wishes to define a different
emitter as the target, the Handoff button is pressed and held to cycle the priority diamond through
the various emitters. Once the desired emitter is focused upon and surrounded with the diamond, the
button can be released, and the priority symbol will remain latched with that emitter, with audio
from the selected emitter played through the intercom, and the double caret (&lt;&gt;) symbol on the
button illuminated to signify latched mode. With a latched diamond focus emitter, the system will
remain focused on said emitter until the signal is either lost, the crew selects another focus
emitter with the Handoff button, or the button is pressed momentarily to return to normal floating
diamond threat priority mode.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/pilot_rwr_handoff.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_handoff" /></p>
<p>In the event that the emitter is tight grouping of other symbols on the display, the TGT SEP mode
will be applied.</p>
<h3 id="missile-launch"><a class="header" href="#missile-launch">Missile Launch</a></h3>
<p>In the event a missile launch is detected by way of discrete SAM guidance commands being received,
the MISSILE LAUNCH indications in this button (<num>4</num>) will illuminate, and a circle is
superimposed
around the threat emitter defined as guiding the inbound weapon. Pressing the button while
illuminated will provide launch audio through the intercom.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_launch_light.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_missile_launch" /></p>
<h3 id="low-altitude-low-alt"><a class="header" href="#low-altitude-low-alt">Low Altitude (LOW ALT)</a></h3>
<p>The ALR-46 utilizes own-ship altitude as a defining aspect of threat priority, thus causing low
altitude AAA and SAM threats to lose priority in the event the aircraft is at an altitude that is
estimated to place it outside of their threat envelope. Activating LOW ALT mode (<num>5</num>)
removes this envelope estimate from the threat prioritization and places low altitude threats back
into priority, useful for circumstances such as a high to low dive attack or target ingress profile,
and is confirmed as the active mode with the illuminated LOW ALT descriptor on the button.</p>
<h3 id="target-separate-tgt-sep"><a class="header" href="#target-separate-tgt-sep">Target Separate (TGT SEP)</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a number of emitters being detected at such close proximity that the symbology
overlaps on the RWR display, the Target Separation button (<num>7</num>) provides the option to
expand symbology on the display from emitters in the same area to allow for clarity on the type and
number of radars being detected. Pressing the button triggers the lower TGT SEP illumination on the
button, and any emitter groups the system defines as being eligible for the expanded presentation
will do so for three seconds on the RWR display before reverting back to the standard view.</p>
<h3 id="system-test-onsys-test"><a class="header" href="#system-test-onsys-test">System Test (ON/SYS TEST)</a></h3>
<p>The system power on test (<num>8</num>) provides a three band (1 low, 2 mid, 3 high) check in all
four quadrants for proper sensitivity, along with an angle confirmation of 225 degree
relative bearing for diagnostic purposes. The test sequence begins with 1s in all four quadrants,
with the lower left value in a diamond (signifying a heading of 225, which is displayed on the
panel); the second and third continue this process, cycling band 2 and band 3. The tests are
accompanied with a sequence of tones for adjustment of audio monitoring level.</p>
<h3 id="unknown-u"><a class="header" href="#unknown-u">Unknown (U)</a></h3>
<p>When an emitter is detected that does not have a catalog entry, but is recognized by received power,
duration, and pulse as being a possible threat, the U indicator on the Unknown button (<num>9</num>)
will flash. Pressing the button will provide a U symbol on the RWR CRT at the correct azimuth
position for reference and monitoring.</p>
<p>The default condition of the Unknown button is with the U symbol illuminated, but steady.</p>
<h3 id="activity-power"><a class="header" href="#activity-power">Activity Power</a></h3>
<p>In the event SAM guidance commands are detected, the ACTIVITY button (<num>10</num>) will
illuminate. This
button's function is similar to the MISSILE LAUNCH indication insofar as that it responds to a
guidance directive to a SAM, but does not respond to discrete changeover signals. Thus, an
illuminated ACTIVITY warning may in fact indicate a launch, depending on the system engaging the F-4
and the circumstances surrounding it. The indication will provide a circle around the threat
emitter.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_activity_light.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_activity_power" /></p>
<h3 id="system-power"><a class="header" href="#system-power">System Power</a></h3>
<p>The System Power button (<num>11</num>) is the on/off switch for the ALR-46. When pressed to
activate the
system, the RWR control panel and display will cycle through their initial 9-second warmup, with the
display and illuminated buttons undergoing rapid flashing as the system is prepared for use and
proper functioning is confirmed. Search mode is deactivated by default upon startup, and if in the
event the aircraft was powered down and restarted, the altitude priority mode (LOW ALT or normal)
will be in the same state it was left prior to shut down.</p>
<p>In the event of a system power failure, the ALR-46 has an automatic restart function. Once power is
recovered, the receiver will restart after a fifteen-second delay, in addition to its 9-second power
on self test. The system will resume state in the same fashion as a normal restart - with Search
mode deactivated and the altitude priority as when power was lost.</p>
<h3 id="excess-noise-strobe-indicators"><a class="header" href="#excess-noise-strobe-indicators">Excess Noise Strobe Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_t_strobe.jpg" alt="rwr_excess_noise_strobe" /></p>
<p>During normal operation, a trio of three T shaped indicators appear in the 9, 12, and 3 o'clock
positions near the center of the RWR CRT. These indicators signify the absence of excess noise in
the low (<num>9</num>), mid (<num>12</num>), and high (<num>3</num>) band amplifier detection. In
the event noise becomes too
significant in a given amplifier channel, the indicator for the respective band will disappear.
Should this occur, a SYS TEST can be performed to confirm the channel is still functioning; in the
event of a pass, the channel can be considered working at a reduced detection capacity.</p>
<p>A fourth indicator may appear as part of the SYS TEST or power up cycle. This fourth indicator in
the 6 o'clock position does not signify any function.</p>
<h3 id="audio-knob"><a class="header" href="#audio-knob">Audio Knob</a></h3>
<p>The AUDIO Knob (<num>6</num>) is the direct volume control for the situational audio from the
ALR-46. Turning
the knob clockwise increases the audio volume, turning counter-clockwise lowers the audio volume.</p>
<h3 id="dim-knob-dimmer"><a class="header" href="#dim-knob-dimmer">DIM Knob (Dimmer)</a></h3>
<p>The DIM knob (<num>12</num>) on the ALR-46 control panel manages the brightness setting of the
illuminated control buttons; turning the knob clockwise increases the brightness, counter-clockwise
reduces the brightness.</p>
<h2 id="symbology-1"><a class="header" href="#symbology-1">Symbology</a></h2>
<p>The ALR-46 features a limited number of symbols for the different radar threats. The following
symbols can stand for the different threats. The ALR-46 can save up to three files containing threat
tables. Those three files contain either a Training set, a Land or a Sea set. The Training file is
not in use at the moment. The land file contains all land and air based threats while the sea file
contains all sea and air based threats. The Pilot can switch between the training and land file by
simply pressing the SYS TEST (<num>8</num>) and within a one second timespan press the TGT
SEP (<num>7</num>) button. A T symbol will be displayed within the lower portion of azimuth when the
training file is selected. To switch to the sea file simply press the SYS TEST (<num>8</num>) button
and within a one second timespan press the Unknown (<num>9</num>) button. When the sea file is
selected a ship symbol will be displayed in the lower half of azimuth.</p>

<h2 id="description-2"><a class="header" href="#description-2">Description</a></h2>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver (RWR) is designed to inform and alert the F-14 crew about radar emitters in their general area. It’s also designed to help the crew defend themselves from hostile threats by indicating radar tracking and engagement by radar-guided weapons.</p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 was integrated into the F-14 to replace the aging AN/ALR-45 and AN/ALR-50, at first for the F-14B and later for parts of the F-14A fleet. Until the advent of the PMDIG upgrade, the AN/ALR-67 used its own stand-alone display system only. The RWR is, however, connected to the AN/ALQ-126, allowing it to send info on threat emitters to the jammer and also display jammed targets on its own display. It can also trigger preprogrammed countermeasure programs set up in the AN/ALE-39 system.</p>
<p>On later F-14B aircraft incorporating the PTID upgrade, the AN/ALR-67 was also integrated into the MDIG displays system, allowing for a more detailed threat display on the ECMD.</p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 on the F-14B has four small spiral high-band antennas, four wideband high-band quadrant receivers, and a low-band array. Connected to these antennas is a narrowband superheterodyne receiver analyzing the received signals and indicating emitters and threats to both pilot and RIO using two displays, one at each seat and by audio signals played to the ICS of both crewmen.</p>
<h2 id="controls"><a class="header" href="#controls">Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/images/control1.png" alt="Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 RWR is controlled by a control panel on the RIO right side horizontal panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PWR (power) switch:</strong> Controls power to the RWR and should be set to ON to operate the system.</li>
<li><strong>VOL (volume) control knob:</strong> Sets RIO audio level for the RWR sound indications. The pilot has a corresponding control on his Volume/TACAN command panel.</li>
<li><strong>TEST switch:</strong> Has two selectable modes and is spring-loaded to center when not held. Momentary selection of the BIT position initiates the AN/ALR-67 built-in test and if the switch is held in the SPL (special) position while on the first BIT page displays the special BIT status page as long as it’s held in that position.</li>
<li><strong>MODE switch:</strong> Also has two selectable modes used while held in the respective position, spring-loaded to return to center when not held. When not activated, it enables normal operational mode, OFST enables the offset mode when held, and LMT the limit mode when held. The offset mode is indicated by an O in the status ring on the display and separates overlapping threat symbols sacrificing azimuth accuracy to instead show all threats clearly. The limit mode is indicated by an L in the status ring on the display and limits the display to only show the threat symbols of the six highest prioritized threats.</li>
<li><strong>DISPLAY TYPE selector:</strong> Sets what threat display priority to use on the RWR displays.
<ul>
<li><strong>NORM:</strong> Normal is indicated by an N in the status ring on the display and shows threat symbology according to the loaded threat library.</li>
<li><strong>AI:</strong> Airborne interceptor is indicated by an I in the status ring on the display and prioritizes all airborne interceptor threats above all other threats.</li>
<li><strong>AAA:</strong> Anti-aircraft artillery is indicated by an A in the status ring on the display and prioritizes all anti-aircraft artillery threats above all other threats.</li>
<li><strong>UNK:</strong> Unknown is indicated by a U in the status ring on the display and prioritizes all unknown threats above all other threats.</li>
<li><strong>FRIEND:</strong> Friendly is indicated by an F in the status ring on the display and allows for the same prioritization as in normal but also displays known friendly emitters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="displays-1"><a class="header" href="#displays-1">Displays</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/images/display.png" alt="Display" /></p>
<p>The RWR display is identical at both positions in the cockpit and uses three bands (circles) on the display to indicate the threat level of the displayed threat symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outermost, critical band:</strong> Displays threat symbols belonging to emitters representing an imminent threat to own aircraft, either a locked-on tracking radar or a radar detected to be actively engaging own aircraft. A threat symbol belonging to a track detected as actively engaging own aircraft is enhanced by flashing its symbol.</li>
<li><strong>Middle, lethal band:</strong> Displays threat symbols belonging to emitters representing threat systems deemed within lethal range of own aircraft but not actively tracking or engaging it.</li>
<li><strong>Inner, non-lethal band:</strong> Displays threat symbols belonging to emitters not representing a system capable of engaging own aircraft or systems capable of but not deemed within range to engage it.</li>
<li><strong>System status circle:</strong> Indicates various system modes in use or the presence of failures. The upper left quadrant displays what display type is set (N, I, A, U, or F), the upper right quadrant showing an L if limited display mode is used, and the lower half indicating either the use of the offset display mode by indicating an O, the presence of a BIT failure by showing B, or that the system is thermally overloaded (too warm) by showing a T.</li>
<li><strong>Display intensity knob:</strong> On the lower right side, it controls display intensity on the display it’s attached to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ordering of the three threat bands has changed at least once since the introduction of the AN/ALR-67, and as the modeled AN/ALR-67 represents one of the earlier versions we’ve chosen the present order.</p>
<h2 id="warning-lights"><a class="header" href="#warning-lights">Warning Lights</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/images/pilotcaution.png" alt="Pilot Caution" /> <img src="systems/defensive_systems/images/riocaution.png" alt="RIO Caution" /></p>
<p>The two crewmembers have warning lights dedicated to specific threats on their front cockpit panels. The pilot warning lights are situated on the right side of the HUD and the RIO warning lights on the right side of the TID. The RIO warning light panel also contains lights for the AN/ALQ-126 and the IFF transponder, those are detailed under their respective section.</p>
<p>The different lights illuminate to indicate the presence of a certain type of threat in the critical band of the RWR and when an active engagement is detected the corresponding light starts flashing. The categories present are SAM (surface-to-air missile), AAA (anti-air artillery), AI (airborne interceptor), and (only in the RIO pit) CW (continuous wave).</p>
<h2 id="threat-indication-alert-tones"><a class="header" href="#threat-indication-alert-tones">Threat Indication Alert Tones</a></h2>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 uses four distinct audio tones to indicate threats and status changes of those threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A single short tone is used to indicate the presence of a new emitter or when a threat is moved to another threat band.</li>
<li>A slow warbling, alternating tone is used to indicate the presence of a threat in the critical band.</li>
<li>A fast warbling, alternating tone is used to indicate that a threat is actively engaging own aircraft.</li>
<li>A special four-tone audio signal, pitch decreasing with each tone, is used to indicate a special event as programmed by the threat library. In the Heatblur DCS F-14 this represents a new threat tied to a system capable of silently engaging own aircraft, i.e. it can engage own aircraft without causing its threat symbol to move to the critical band and thus no additional audio warning tones. This capability is either because the launching aircraft is capable of launching missiles in a TWS mode or that a launching SAM system can guide missiles by other means than radar and thus not giving further warning of an active engagement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bit"><a class="header" href="#bit">BIT</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/images/bit.gif" alt="BIT" /></p>
<p>The AN/ALR-67 BIT cycles between different test screens testing the screen, symbology, and threat indication tones as well as displaying system revision and threat library information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first page displayed shows system and threat library revision and the following screens test the symbol generation of the displays.</li>
<li>The threat indication tones are also tested during the BIT, first page tests the status change tone, second page the special tone, third page the threat in critical band tone, and the fourth the fast warbling active threat tone.</li>
<li>During the tests the threat warning lights also illuminate for both the pilot and the RIO.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threat-symbology"><a class="header" href="#threat-symbology">Threat Symbology</a></h2>
<p>The following table details the threat symbols used by the Heatblur DCS F-14 with the AN/ALR-67.</p>

<p>The AN/ALQ-100 and 126 jammers are designed to detect radar threats, analyze them, select the optimum countermeasure technique available and apply it. Available techniques for jamming are, among others, mainlobe blanking, inverse con-scan, range-gate pull-off, and swept square modes.</p>
<p>In real life, these two systems differ greatly, with the AN/ALR-126 being by far the most effective system. In DCS, both are modeled as simple noise jammers due to engine limitations but controlled by the DECM logic as to when it’s on or off and thus work the same.</p>
<h2 id="decm-controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#decm-controls-and-indicators">DECM Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/control2.png" alt="Control Panel" /></p>
<p>The controls for the DECM are all located on the right horizontal panel in the RIO pit, as shown in the image above. In addition, there are two indication lights co-located with the RWR threat indicators on the right side of the TID.</p>
<p>The two indication lights on the threat advisory are <strong>RCV (receive)</strong> and <strong>XMIT (transmit)</strong>. <strong>RCV</strong> illuminates when the system detects and analyzes a threat, while the <strong>XMIT</strong> illuminates when it’s actively jamming a threat.</p>
<p>The control panel itself contains a <strong>STANDBY</strong> indicator light, a mode selector knob, and an <strong>AUDIO</strong> volume knob.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>STANDBY</strong> light indicates that system warmup is not yet completed and turns off when completed. At other times, illumination of this indicator indicates the presence of a fault in the system.</li>
<li>The <strong>AUDIO (volume)</strong> knob controls the audio volume of the RIO sound from the system. The pilot has no access to this audio. The audio itself is generated from the PRF of received threats with PRF frequency being converted to audio frequency.</li>
<li>The mode selector knob controls power and operational mode of the system:
<ul>
<li><strong>OFF</strong> turns off power to the system.</li>
<li><strong>STBY</strong> begins pre-warming of the system, taking around 5 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>TEST - HOLD 3 SEC</strong> is used to prepare the system for BIT. After 3 seconds in this mode, turn the knob to TEST - ACT.</li>
<li><strong>TEST - ACT</strong> starts the BIT in the system. The BIT takes approximately 30 seconds, and the <strong>RCV</strong> light will be illuminated the whole time while the <strong>XMIT</strong> light will flash twice. If the <strong>STANDBY</strong> light illuminates, it indicates that a no-go condition exists in the system.</li>
<li><strong>REC</strong> enables the system in receive-only mode, enabling analysis of threats and also the threat audio.</li>
<li><strong>RPT</strong> enables full system functionality; in addition to <strong>REC</strong>, it also tries to jam threats according to the selected method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In DCS, jamming is always done with noise jamming, turning on as a threat is detected.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_master_caution_light.jpg" alt="pilot_master_caution" /></p>
<p>Found in the front cockpit, the MASTER CAUTION provides the pilot with an
up-front warning of potential hazard to the aircraft. The MASTER CAUTION
illuminates concurrently with most warning lamps on the telelight panel and the
generator indicators; warnings that do not set off MASTER CAUTION are noted in
the Telelight Panel list.</p>
<p>MASTER CAUTION can be deactivated by the pilot pressing the reset button on the
right console. However, it is important to note that pressing MASTER CAUTION
does not clear a warning on the telelight panel; instead, the warning will

<h2 id="ejection-seats"><a class="header" href="#ejection-seats">Ejection Seats</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/ext_f4_ejection.jpg" alt="ext_view_ejection_seat" /></p>
<p>The Phantom II uses the Martin Baker Mk. H-7 ejection seat in both positions for
safe aircrew extraction in the event of airframe loss. Triggering ejection using
the face curtain or lower ejection handles fires the seat mounted initiator that
jettisons the canopy. Once the canopy is clear of the airframe, the ejection gun
primary charge fires, unlatching the seat from the cockpit and initiating seat
climb-out. As the seat rises, restraints on the legs pull them back for clearance
and the drogue timer is set. At the appropriate height, a lanyard attaching the
rocket motor initiator to the airframe trips the firing pin for the main rocket
engine to clear the aircraft. The previously set drogue gun fires at this time,
deploying a pair of small chutes to stabilize the seat in attitude and initiate
deceleration.</p>
<p>Once the seat has reached a pre-set barometric altitude between 11,500 and
14,500 feet, or momentarily after stabilization if lower, scissor mechanisms
release the crew-member with the survival kit-containing seat pan from the
ejection frame and deploys the main chute. In the event of ejection below the
barostat altitude, the WSO chute is fully deployed at 5 seconds after ejection
initiation, and the pilot one-second later.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/wso_eject_light.jpg" alt="wso_eject_light" /></p>
<p>In the event of loss of intercom power, the pilot can warn the WSO to prepare
for ejection by pressing the EJECT switch found on the left canopy sill forward
of the flap switch. This illuminates a pair of warning lamps found on the rear
cockpit indicator panel. This can also be done by the WSO to warn the Pilot of an ejection.</p>

the rear seat - both seats, or the rear seat only. The handle is marked PLT EJECT
PULL TURN. When the handle is oriented vertically, single seat ejection is
selected; to set dual seat ejection, the handle is rotated clockwise to the
horizontal.</p>

<p><img src="stores/../img/m61.jpg" alt="M-61 Vulcan" />
U.S. Navy photo by Photographers Mate Airman Kristopher Wilson. (041129-N-5345W-034)</p>
<p>The M-61 Vulcan is a six-barreled hydraulically driven 20 mm automatic cannon capable of firing over 6,000 rpm (rounds per minute).</p>
<p>The F-14 carries the gun internally mounted beneath the cockpit with the muzzle being located on the lower left side of the fuselage. 676 20 mm rounds are carried in the ammunition drum for the gun and retain the spent cases after the rounds have been fired.</p>
<p>The gun itself is mounted to be elevated slightly more than 3° from the ADL to provide built-in lead for dog-fight situations.</p>
<p>To fire the gun, no input is needed from the WCS, the gun can be fired by the trigger on the pilot stick when selected by the weapons selector on that same stick, provided master arm is on. The WCS can, however, provide symbology on the HUD to increase gun accuracy. For both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes the gun has two sights available. For air-to-air it’s the manual sight and the RTGS (real-time gun sight).</p>
<p>Selection of the gun is indicated on the bottom of the HUD by a capital G with remaining hundreds of rounds indicated below.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/rounds.png" alt="Rounds Indicator" />
Apart from the indication on the HUD, the rounds remaining indicator on the pilot right vertical panel also shows remaining rounds. The indicator counts down from 650 but can manually be reset by rotating the knob below the indicator to the desired quantity.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/rate.png" alt="Gun Rate Selector" />
The gun is capable of a 4,000 rpm or 6,000 rpm mode. The lower rate is normally used for air-to-ground engagement and the higher rate for air-to-air engagement. The gun rate is selected by the GUN RATE switch on the ACM, which also indicates the selected option. Selection of ACM will set it to high automatically. The maximum number of bullets fired by a trigger pull can be set to be either 50, 100, 200, or unlimited. The default value is 200 bullets but can be set otherwise by the ground crew.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In DCS this is set via the kneeboard.</p>
<h2 id="manual-air-to-air-sight"><a class="header" href="#manual-air-to-air-sight">Manual Air-to-Air Sight</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/gunhudmanual.png" alt="Manual Air-to-Air Sight" />
In manual mode, the HUD displays the ADL, the armament legend, and the manual pipper. This mode is accessed by depressing and releasing the CAGE/SEAM pushbutton on the left throttle when in the air-to-air mode with the gun selected. In this mode, the pilot has to manually aim the gun using the manual pipper as a reference to hit the target. Real target range and needed deflection need to be estimated by the pilot.</p>
<p>The manual piper is adjustable to enable the selection of the desired lead. The GUN ELEV panel on the pilot right vertical panel sets the lead; normally, this should be set to 53 milliradians to place the manual pipper on the gun sight line.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/gunelevation1.png" alt="Gun Elevation Panel" /></p>
<h2 id="real-time-gunsight-rtgs"><a class="header" href="#real-time-gunsight-rtgs">Real-Time Gunsight (RTGS)</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/gunhudrtgsnotarget.png" alt="RTGS No Target" />
The real-time gunsight mode is the standard gun mode when in the air-to-air mode with the gun selected.</p>
<p>In RTGS, the WCS computes the bullet trajectory and displays the location the bullets will pass through at 1,000 and 2,000 feet, if no target data is available from the WCS. The pipper represents bullet location at 1,000 feet and the diamond represents the bullet location at 2,000 feet.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/gunhudrtgs.png" alt="RTGS Target" />
If target data is available from the WCS (target tracked in an STT mode), the pipper instead displays bullet location at the target’s current range out to 4,000 feet. The diamond will display radar line of sight to the target (target location). This means that when having a target track, the pilot should fly the aircraft to place the pipper over the target to hit it.</p>
<p>In addition to computing the solution to put bullets at the target's location, the RTGS sight will also calculate where the bullets actually are in relation to the target when at target range. When the bullets fired are computed to be at the target’s location, the diamond switches from target indication to indicating bullet position at target range (BATR). This is also indicated by the diamond flashing.</p>
<p>Using this symbology, it’s possible to see where the target would have needed to be to be hit by the bullets. If the gun engagement was executed successfully, this means that the diamond should still be on top of the target, blinking, indicating that the bullets passed through the target’s location.</p>
<h2 id="manual-air-to-ground-sight"><a class="header" href="#manual-air-to-ground-sight">Manual Air-to-Ground Sight</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/attkmode.png" alt="Attack Mode" />
The manual air-to-ground sight works and looks the same way as the manual air-to-air sight except that it’s set by the RIO using the ATTK MODE selector on the armament control panel that’s located on the RIO left vertical panel. Selecting MAN on that selector enables the same HUD symbology as in the manual air-to-air sight upon the selection of the air-to-ground mode, the only additional HUD symbology being the display of the radar altitude on the right side of the HUD. The gun deflection should instead be set according to a pre-calculated setting depending on airspeed, target range, and dive angle.</p>
<h2 id="computerpilot-mode"><a class="header" href="#computerpilot-mode">Computer/Pilot Mode</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/guncomputerpilot.png" alt="Computer/Pilot Mode" />
Computer/pilot mode is used to have the WCS continuously compute a weapon impact point for, among other air-to-ground weapons, the gun. It is set by the RIO on the ATTK MODE selector, as for manual air-to-ground sight, by selecting CMPTR-PLT.</p>
<p>In this mode, the AN/AWG-9 radar is slaved to the weapon impact point for accurate range measurements and enables the HUD display of that same impact point.</p>
<p>The HUD uses the pipper to indicate a real-time weapon impact point and the diamond to indicate out of range. When the diamond disappears, the gun is in range to engage a target under the pipper. The pull-up cue moves vertically on the HUD and when it’s at or above the weapon impact point (pipper), it indicates that an immediate pull-up is required to avoid striking the ground and that the target is too close to engage safely.</p>
<p>The right side of the HUD displays the barometric altitude scale.</p>
<h2 id="mixed-gun-mode"><a class="header" href="#mixed-gun-mode">Mixed Gun Mode</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/gunmixed.png" alt="Mixed Mode" />
The gun can also be used at the same time as another air-to-ground munition is selected by setting the A/G GUN switch on the armament panel (on the RIO left vertical panel) to MIXED. This enables the trigger to fire the gun but no HUD symbology is available for the gun as it’s being used to display release data for the selected munition. In this mode, the pilot needs to estimate the gun impact point manually with the ADL as the only reference on the HUD.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="air-to-air"><a class="header" href="#air-to-air">Air to Air</a></h1>
<h2 id="hud-symbology-for-air-to-air-missiles"><a class="header" href="#hud-symbology-for-air-to-air-missiles">HUD Symbology for Air-to-Air Missiles</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/a2ahud.png" alt="a2ahud" /></p>
<p>The above image shows the HUD with Phoenixes selected while in air-to-air display mode.</p>
<p>As standard the HUD shows the Closure Rate on the left side in hundreths of knots, from -200 to +1,000 knots. Current closure rate as displayed by a &lt;.</p>
<p>Additionally it displays the Target Range Scale on the right side, showing target range at the displayed scale, 10 NM in this case as display at the upper end. The target range scale shows the current target range with a &gt; and selected weapon max and minimum ranges as indicated by the dashes (-).</p>
<p>The Movable Reticle (called pipper for air to ground and gun employment) and the Target Designator can show different things depending on current situation.</p>
<p>The Movable Reticle shows current TCS line of sight if it exists at the same time as a radar STT lock except for when AIM-9s are selected. In the AIM-9 case it instead shows current AIM-9 seeker head line of sight.</p>
<p>The Target Designator diamond shows current radar STT line of sight if present and if not it instead shows the current TCS line of sight.</p>
<p>So effectually the TCS line of sight can be shown either by the movable reticle or the target designator depending on if a radar STT is also present and if a radar STT is present with AIM-9 selected it’s not shown at all.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aim-7-sparrow"><a class="header" href="#aim-7-sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/aim-7.jpg" alt="AIM-7 Sparrow" />
U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s Mate 3rd Class Joshua Karsten. (041108-N-8704K-008)</p>
<p>The AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile is a supersonic boost-glide missile capable of engaging both aircraft and missiles in all weather conditions. The AIM-7 Sparrow missile is a medium-range air-to-air missile with a max range of at least 16 NM (30 km) for the AIM-7E and at least 38 NM (70 km) for the AIM-7F and AIM-7M. The all-weather capability comes from the missile being radar-guided, more exactly SARH (semi-active radar homing). This means that the seeker of the Sparrow relies on the AN/AWG-9 painting the targets for it and following the radar emissions being reflected off the target.</p>
<p>The F-14 can carry the AIM-7E, AIM-7F, and AIM-7M on four dedicated recesses on the aircraft fuselage and one each on the glove pylons.</p>
<p>Apart from the various improvements to the missile range, seeker, and warhead, the major difference between the different versions is that the AIM-7F and newer missiles can also be guided via pulse doppler illumination in addition to CW as opposed to only CW.</p>
<h2 id="missile-preparation"><a class="header" href="#missile-preparation">Missile Preparation</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/mslprep.png" alt="Missile Preparation" />
Before launch, the AIM-7 missiles need to be prepared by the selection of the MSL PREP-ON pushbutton on the pilot ACM panel. This commands the WCS to start missile preparation for the AIM-7 and AIM-54.</p>
<p>In the case of the AIM-7, the WCS applies electrical power to the missile to pre-heat the electronics and gyros. It also injects CW radar video from the radar to the missiles via an emitter on the aft end of the rail to a receiver at the aft end of the missile. This video is used to tune the AIM-7 missile to the selected CW frequency on the RIO DDD panel. When the individual missiles are tuned and ready, the corresponding missile status windows turn white to indicate a ready missile.</p>
<h2 id="launch-modes"><a class="header" href="#launch-modes">Launch Modes</a></h2>
<p>The two available launch modes for the AIM-7 on the F-14 are the normal mode and the boresight mode. To select the AIM-7 for launch, the pilot selects the SP/PH (sparrow/phoenix) position on the stick weapon selector. Selection of which Sparrow to launch is done automatically by the WCS.</p>
<p>Depression of the weapon selector switches from SP to PH and vice versa. If an STT target is available, the WCS will automatically use the normal mode for launch unless BRSIT (boresight) is selected on the MSL MODE (missile mode) switch on the ACM panel. In all other cases, the boresight mode will be used.</p>
<h3 id="normal-mode"><a class="header" href="#normal-mode">Normal Mode</a></h3>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/msloptionsp.png" alt="Missile Options" />
As the normal mode is used to engage a target tracked in STT, the WCS is capable of using both CW and pulse doppler for guidance. When using CW in the normal mode, the AN/AWG-9 radar uses a dedicated CW antenna to spotlight the tracked target more directly than via the flood antenna. While CW is the normal guidance mode for all AIM-7 variants, it is possible to select the pulse doppler guidance mode instead when using the AIM-7F and AIM-7M missiles.</p>
<p>This is done on the RIO's armament panel with the MSL OPTIONS switch by setting it to SP DP (sparrow doppler). When selected, this causes the WCS to guide the Sparrow missiles using pulse doppler illumination instead.</p>
<p>Regardless of guidance mode, the WCS calculates the missile LAR (launch acceptance region) and displays the missile launch ranges on the VDI and TID. The HUD shows the target diamond and current target range, Rmin and Rmax, while the VDI, DDD, and TID display the attack guidance symbology as well as the above-mentioned missile LAR indications.</p>
<h3 id="boresight-mode"><a class="header" href="#boresight-mode">Boresight Mode</a></h3>
<p>The boresight mode uses the CW flood antenna on the AN/AWG-9 radar and will cause the missile to track the strongest target return within the flood area. In addition to when launched in boresight mode, the radar will also switch to flood mode when a target is lost, either before launch or after launch, enabling the pilot to try and save the shot by keeping the target within the flood area.</p>

<p>The AIM-9 Sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile. It uses an infrared seeker locking on to a target's IR signature, making it capable of tracking a target both during daytime and at night.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat is capable of carrying all Navy versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder from the AIM-9D up to the AIM-9M. The Heatblur F-14 Tomcat is currently modeled as carrying the AIM-9L and AIM-9M.</p>
<p>The F-14 is capable of carrying the AIM-9 on stations 1A &amp; B and 8A &amp; B. Stations 1 &amp; 8 are the glove pylons, which can each carry two AIM-9s for a total of 4. Station 1A &amp; 8A are dedicated to carry only the AIM-9 and are normally used when only carrying two to allow station 1B &amp; 8B to carry other munitions.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/swcool.png" alt="Missile Preparation" />
The cooling of the AIM-9 seeker head needs to be enabled before launch. This is done by pressing the SW COOL switch on the pilot ACM panel or by selecting the ACM mode on the same panel. This commands cooling of the missile's seeker head. The missile will immediately show ready, but full seeker head performance will take at least 60 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="seeker-head-modes"><a class="header" href="#seeker-head-modes">Seeker Head Modes</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-9G introduced a seeker head capable of the Sidewinder expanded acquisition mode (SEAM), and all later Sidewinders carried by the F-14 are also capable of that mode. SEAM allows the missile seeker head to be uncaged to track a target within the seeker limits (40° from ADL), allowing the pilot to lead the target, improving missile performance. It also allows for the WCS on the F-14 to slave the seeker to a tracked target within 20° from ADL, allowing for off-boresight acquisition.</p>
<p>The AIM-9 on the F-14 can still use the old boresight mode where the seeker head remains slaved to ADL (2.5° field of view), but normally SEAM is used to scan the seeker about either ADL or a tracked target. This scan is not visible to the pilot and is done to increase effective seeker head field of view. As with all Sidewinders, target detection is indicated by an aural tone. That growling tone is present while scanning but increases in intensity while the seeker is looking at an IR source.</p>
<h2 id="missile-operation"><a class="header" href="#missile-operation">Missile Operation</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-9 Sidewinder is selected for launch with the weapon selector on the pilot stick. The weapon selector can be used to cycle which AIM-9 is selected for launch by depressing it, indicating on the ACM panel which missile is selected by a checkerboard indication in the corresponding status window. When using the AIM-9, the HUD uses the diamond to indicate a tracked target and the pipper (crosshair) to indicate current seeker head position. If a WCS track with range is available, the HUD also displays range to target and Rmin and Rmax. The VDI, DDD, and TID display the attack guidance symbology if a WCS track is present.</p>
<p>The basic missile boresight mode without SEAM (no scan) is commanded by depressing the BRSIT (boresight) switch on the pilot ACM panel while not having the ACM mode active. In this mode, the pilot puts the target at ADL and fires when the aural tone is present.</p>
<p>If the BRSIT switch is not used or the ACM mode is active, the AIM-9 will use the SEAM and set the missile to use the double-D scan pattern. If a WCS target is present, the seeker head will scan around the radar or TCS line of sight; otherwise, the missile will scan around the ADL.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/seamlock.png" alt="SEAM Lock" />
To enable lock-on to a target in SEAM, the pilot depresses the CAGE/SEAM pushbutton on the left throttle. This illuminates the SEAM LOCK light on the ACM panel and uncages the seeker for 4.5 seconds, allowing it to track a target present in the seeker's field of view. If no IR source is found, the missile is again caged and the SEAM LOCK light is deactivated.</p>
<p>If lock-on is successful, the aural tone will remain and the SEAM LOCK light stays illuminated, allowing the pilot to launch the missile by pressing the stick trigger. After launch, the next AIM-9 will automatically be selected.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/aim-54.jpg" alt="AIM-54" />
<em>U.S. Navy photo by Photographer’s Mate 2nd Class Felix Garza Jr. (030320-N-4142G-013)</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depicted missile has yet to have the forward fins attached.</p>
<p>The AIM-54 Phoenix is a long-range air-to-air missile originally designed for the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, which never materialized. When the F-111B project was scrapped, the AIM-54 and the corresponding AN/AWG-9 WCS eventually found their way to the F-14.</p>
<p>The F-14 is capable of carrying up to 6 AIM-54 missiles, four on rails on the fuselage and one each on the glove pylons. Because of the missile cooling system used, the two front Phoenix pylons must always be mounted, meaning that the rear fuselage pylons can’t be used if the front ones aren’t present. The glove pylons contain their own cooling systems.</p>
<p>The missile is capable of engagement both against a single target in STT and multiple targets using track-while-search (TWS).</p>
<p>The AIM-54 is available in two different versions, the AIM-54A and the AIM-54C. The Heatblur Simulations F-14 Tomcat models both versions as well as the AIM-54A with both mk47 and mk60 rocket motors. The two motors on the AIM-54A differ in effective range, while the AIM-54C differs by having a digital seeker instead of an analog one, increasing its performance, as well as an improved, smokeless mk47 rocket motor.</p>
<p>The AIM-54 has a range of at least 60 NM against a fighter-sized target at high altitudes in pulse doppler STT. When using TWS for engagement against multiple targets, this drops to about 50 NM. It has a greater range against large targets and vice versa against smaller targets.</p>
<p>If launched in active mode, the range drops to about 10 NM for a fighter-sized target, varying slightly with target size. Notably, the missile will revert to SARH mode if no target is detected if selected for active launch in a SARH mode.</p>
<h2 id="missile-preparation-2"><a class="header" href="#missile-preparation-2">Missile Preparation</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-54 missile preparation is started by selecting the MSL PREP switch on the pilot ACM panel or by activating the ACM. This enables power and cooling to the missile and also starts the built-in tests in the missile (BIT).</p>
<p>As with the AIM-7, the AIM-54 is tuned before launch using a transmitter on the rear end of the missile rail, transmitting to the rear receiver of the missile. The whole missile preparation cycle is completed after around 2 minutes, at which time the AIM-54 missiles are indicated ready in the corresponding missile status windows on the pilot ACM.</p>
<h2 id="launch-modes-1"><a class="header" href="#launch-modes-1">Launch Modes</a></h2>
<p>The seeker head used in the AIM-54 is capable of both semi-active radar homing (SARH) and active radar homing (ARH).</p>
<p>Normally, the launch to eject (LTE) cycle of the missile is 3 seconds, meaning the time from trigger depression to missile ejection. The exception is the ACM active mode, where the LTE is shortened to 1 second if within 15° from ADL.</p>
<h3 id="tws-sarharh"><a class="header" href="#tws-sarharh">TWS SARH/ARH</a></h3>
<p>In TWS, the AN/AWG-9 is capable of supporting the launch of up to 6 AIM-54 missiles against 6 different targets concurrently. In the first stage of the AIM-54 engagement, the missile is guided semi-actively by the AN/AWG-9 radar using both guidance commands transmitted via the radar and radar energy reflected off the target. Then, when the missile is within range of its seeker’s ARH mode, the AN/AWG-9 commands the missile to switch to ARH.</p>
<p>Absence of this command via the AN/AWG-9 radar means that the missile won’t switch to the ARH mode. The AN/AWG-9, however, continues to transmit guidance commands to the missile as a fallback in case the missile can’t acquire the target autonomously. This means that the AIM-54 isn’t a “fire and forget” missile per se, but it can be considered autonomous after transfer to ARH.</p>
<h3 id="pd-stt-sarh"><a class="header" href="#pd-stt-sarh">PD STT SARH</a></h3>
<p>In pulse doppler STT, the AIM-54 uses SARH all the way to the target, receiving guidance commands at a greater rate than in TWS and also continuous spotlighting of the target because of the STT mode being used. This increases the effective range of the AIM-54 seeker slightly.</p>
<h3 id="active-radar-homing-arh"><a class="header" href="#active-radar-homing-arh">Active-Radar Homing (ARH)</a></h3>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/msloptionph.png" alt="Active-Radar Homing" />
The AIM-54 can also be commanded to go active directly after launch in both TWS and pulse doppler STT modes by setting the MSL OPTIONS switch to PH ACT before launch. This tells the WCS to immediately command the AIM-54 to go active in the first guidance command after launch. If launched at a target within 6 NM in the target's rear hemisphere or 10 NM in its forward hemisphere, the WCS will also automatically command this mode instead of a SARH mode.</p>
<p>If the target is not detected actively by the seeker, it will still fall back to SARH until the seeker can acquire on its own, like in the two SARH modes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Setting the MSL OPTIONS switch to PH ACT with an AIM-54 in the air will not make it go active; the PH ACT option can only be set before missile launch.</p>
<h3 id="acm-active"><a class="header" href="#acm-active">ACM Active</a></h3>
<p>The last mode is ACM active, in which the missile is commanded active before launch, making this the only mode where the missile is truly fire and forget. The AIM-54 missile receives the active message before launch from the WCS in addition to a command prepositioning the seeker head to have it look at the current WCS track if available.</p>
<p>ACM active is commanded when BRSIT (boresight) is selected on the pilot ACM panel, when having the ACM active without a WCS track, and when using a non-pulse doppler radar mode or TCS track. When using boresight or ACM without a track, the missile will launch along the ADL, locking onto the first target seen while launching at a non-pulse doppler radar track, the seeker head will be prepositioned onto that track.</p>
<h2 id="ecm-mode"><a class="header" href="#ecm-mode">ECM Mode</a></h2>
<p>In all of the guidance modes, the seeker head automatically switches to a passive ECM follow if jammed, angle-tracking the target until it can again track the target using SARH or ARH. This is done without crew action and is not indicated to the operator.</p>
<h2 id="missile-operation-1"><a class="header" href="#missile-operation-1">Missile Operation</a></h2>
<p>The AIM-54 missile is selected with the weapon selector on the pilot stick by selecting the SP/PH (sparrow/phoenix) position and then depressing the selector to switch from SP to PH. It is possible to switch back to SP by again depressing the weapon selector.</p>
<p>When used in boresight or ACM without a WCS track, the HUD will not indicate any symbology apart from the ADL, which is used to aim the missile.</p>
<p>When selected with a WCS track in STT, the HUD will display the Target Designator, and if a TCS track exists, the Movable Reticle overlaying the target, the former indicating WCS track and the latter TCS line of sight. The range scale on the right side of the HUD indicates range to target and Rmin and Rmax, while the VDI, DDD, and TID display the attack guidance symbology.</p>
<h3 id="tws"><a class="header" href="#tws">TWS</a></h3>
<p>When using the AIM-54 with TWS, the WCS automatically prioritizes the tracked targets, giving them a firing order number indicating missile launch order. As the first target is launched at, the first track’s number is removed, and the other tracks’ numbers are decreased by one.</p>
<p>To continue to engage tracks 2 through 6, the pilot depresses the trigger once for each target, waits until the missile is clear, and then depresses the trigger again for the next missile, and so on until the desired number of missiles are away.</p>
<p>After missile launch, the prioritization numbers on the right side of the targeted tracks are replaced with the TTI or Time to Impact number, showing calculated time until missile hits the target.</p>
<p>Additionally, when the AN/AWG-9 has sent the active command to the missile, the TTI numbers blink, indicating that the missile targeting the track has been commanded to active mode. When this happens depends on the setting of the TGTS switch on the DDD. SMALL equals 6NM, NORM equals 10NM, and LARGE equals 13NM. The setting set before launch is used.</p>
<p>The targets currently under missile attack brighten until estimated time to target plus 15 seconds has elapsed, and when at 15 seconds past estimated time to the last target, the break-away cross is also displayed on the VDI, DDD, and TID.</p>
<p>For more info regarding the applicable TID symbology, see TID Symbology.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/TWS.png" alt="TWS" />
It is possible to force the WCS to include a target by setting it to mandatory attack using the CAP and also to exclude a target by setting it to do not attack on the same panel. In addition, it is possible to command the WCS to set a track as priority 1 in the firing order by hooking it and pressing NEXT LAUNCH on the RIO armament panel.</p>
<p>If not already in TWS AUTO, the WCS automatically switches to this mode, thus assuming control over the AN/AWG-9 radar to keep the engaged targets illuminated. In addition to the track numbering, the TID also displays a steering centroid indicating the center weight of the TWS scan pattern.</p>
<p>The HUD and VDI display a steering cue guiding the pilot towards optimal target illumination and also display range and Rmin and Rmax to target number 1. The TID displays the complete attack symbology with target prioritization numbers and individual optimum launch ranges. For more info, see Track While Scan (TWS).</p>
<h2 id="aim-54-in-dcs"><a class="header" href="#aim-54-in-dcs">AIM-54 in DCS</a></h2>
<p>The HB DCS F-14 includes custom AIM-54A and AIM-54C missiles, the AIM-54A with a choice of two different rocket motors. The aerodynamics and engine performance for these missiles have been extensively researched and computer simulated to make the included missiles behave as realistically as possible in regards to aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Regarding missile seeker and flight profile, we’ve worked with Eagle Dynamics to enable our F-14 AN/AWG-9 to control the AIM-54 to a degree. In DCS, this means the following:</p>
<p>In TWS, the missiles will fly out using guidance from the AN/AWG-9 until about 16 seconds to impact, at which time the AN/AWG-9 will tell the missile to go active if it’s still within the radar scan zone. The exact distance at which the AN/AWG-9 sends the ATC depends on the setting of the TGTS switch, as detailed above. This results in a silent engagement until the missiles go active, at which time the target’s radar warning receiver will get an indication of an active missile engaging it. If fired at range, the AIM-54 will loft for greater range. Setting the different seeker activation ranges impacts the amount of warning the target will get but also the amount of time the missile needs to be supported.</p>
<p>In PD-STT (Pulse-Doppler Single Target Track), the AIM-54 will be launched in a pure semi-active mode and be guided in that mode all the way to the target without going active. This means that the engaged target will get an immediate engagement warning through its radar warning receiver from the AN/AWG-9 as soon as the AIM-54 leaves the rail. Like in TWS, the missile will loft if fired at range.</p>
<p>For all other modes and within 10NM of the target (or in ACM or PH ACT), the AIM-54 will launch active off the rail, and the targeted aircraft will immediately see the missile’s own radar actively engaging it. It will not loft in this case, and thus the range is less than in the other two cases.</p>

<p>The AIM-54C in DCS currently is not affected by the Target Size Switch.</p>

<p>Despite being primarily designed as an air superioty fighter and an interceptor the F-14 was from the very start cleared and tested to carry all of the modern American general purpose bombs (GP) of the Mk-80 series. In addition it was also cleared to carry the Mk-20 Rockeye cluster bomb and the 5” Zuni folding-fin aircraft rocket (FFAR).</p>
<p>As the F-14’s combat role changed to include the precision ground attack mission it was also cleared to carry several of the guided bomb unit (GBU) versions of the Mk-80 series bombs, more specifically, some of the laser guided versions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="air-to-ground-weapon-settings"><a class="header" href="#air-to-ground-weapon-settings">Air-to-Ground Weapon Settings</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/images/armamentpanel1.png" alt="Armament Panel" />
The air-to-ground weapon delivery is set up by the RIO on his armament panel on the left vertical panel of the RIO cockpit.</p>
<p>The type of munition for delivery is set up by the wheel on the top of the panel, turning it to the correct munition. This configures the WCS with the correct parameters for the selected munition.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Mk-81, 82, and 83 have both an L and an H option for low-drag and high-drag versions, respectively.</p>
<p>Under <strong>DLVY MODE</strong> (delivery mode), it is possible to set STP/RPL (step/ripple) and SGL/PRS (single/pairs). The possible combinations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STP and SGL</strong>: Releases one store with each depression of the bomb release button on the pilot stick.</li>
<li><strong>STP and PRS</strong>: As with STP and SGL but each depression of the bomb release button on the pilot stick releases a pair of stores. Only works for paired stations, 1 with 8, 3 with 6, and 4 with 5.</li>
<li><strong>RPL and SGL</strong>: Used with all attack modes, each depression of the bomb release button on the pilot stick releases a set amount of stores set by the <strong>QTY</strong> (quantity) wheels with the interval set by the <strong>INTERVAL</strong> wheels (in milliseconds).</li>
<li><strong>RPL and PRS</strong>: As RPL and SGL but each release pulse releases a pair of stores, <strong>QTY</strong> still sets the total amount of stores to be released.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>MECH FUSE</strong> switch sets which mechanical fuse to arm on the stores. <strong>NOSE</strong> arms the nose fuse, <strong>SAFE</strong> inhibits arming of the fuses, and <strong>NOSE/TAIL</strong> arms both fuses.</p>
<p>The <strong>ELEC FUSE</strong> selector knob sets the electrical fuse of the store to be released:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAFE</strong>: Inhibits electrical bomb fusing.</li>
<li><strong>VT</strong>: Sets air-burst mode at preset burst height for compatible stores.</li>
<li><strong>INST</strong>: Sets instantaneous burst mode.</li>
<li><strong>DLY 1</strong>: Sets preset time delay 1.</li>
<li><strong>DLY 2</strong>: Sets preset time delay 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>INTERVAL</strong> and <strong>QTY</strong> (quantity) wheels set the release interval (in milliseconds) and quantity of stores to be released, compatible with the delivery modes as seen above under <strong>DLVY MODE</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <strong>6 STA SEL</strong> (station select) switches set which pylons to use for store delivery (also used for selection of what stores to jettison). To select a pylon for store delivery, set the corresponding switch to <strong>SEL</strong>. Stations 1 and 8 should be set to <strong>B</strong> for selection, <strong>SW</strong> was used to jettison AIM-9 Sidewinders but is now inoperable.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All F-14 bombs in DCS are assumed to have both types of fuzes, so both the mechanical and electrical fuze need to be set. GBUs, Mk-20s, and Mk-81 to 84s need the mechanical fuze set to either <strong>N</strong> or <strong>N/T</strong> settings, the Mk-82AIR (ballute) and Mk-82 Snake-Eye can be dropped in free-fall with <strong>N</strong> and retarded with <strong>N/T</strong>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="air-to-ground-weapon-delivery"><a class="header" href="#air-to-ground-weapon-delivery">Air-to-Ground Weapon Delivery</a></h1>
<p>Air-to-ground delivery is initiated by pilot selection of the <strong>A/G</strong> mode on the display control panel. After tape read-in (about 30 seconds), the WCS initiates the air-to-ground mode and enables relevant symbology on the displays.</p>
<p>The weapon selection automatically switches to ordnance (<strong>ORD</strong> on the HUD) unless the pilot has selected another weapon. All other options are set by the RIO in the back seat.</p>
<p>The available attack modes in the F-14 are set by the <strong>ATTK MODE</strong> selector in the RIO pit and are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CMPTR TGT</strong>: Computer target, a semi-automatic computer-guided mode similar to a CCRP mode in newer aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>CMPTR IP</strong>: Computer initial point, an extended CMPTR TGT mode using a known initial point (IP) as a reference for store delivery. Mostly used in situations where the actual target is expected to be hard to locate visually and is located closely to an easily identifiable reference point/landmark.</li>
<li><strong>CMPTR PLT</strong>: Computer pilot, a manual computer and pilot-guided mode using the WCS for store impact point indication on HUD. Similar to a CCIP mode in newer aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>MAN</strong>: Manual, manual backup mode in which the HUD displays a pipper (crosshair) on the HUD at the deflection set by the pilot. Used in case of a systems failure prohibiting the other modes.</li>
<li><strong>D/L BOMB</strong>: Data-link bomb, an automatic mode in which the pilot is steered via data-link cues for remotely controlled store delivery. (Not implemented in DCS at this point in time.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="computer-target"><a class="header" href="#computer-target">Computer Target</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/images/cmptrtgt.png" alt="Computer Target" />
The computer target mode allows the pilot to designate a target onto which the WCS then guides the pilot towards store release. This mode is usable for all air-to-ground stores, including rockets.</p>
<p>When selected, the HUD displays the diamond as target designator and the bomb fall line (BFL) through the velocity vector and store impact point pipper (crosshair).</p>
<p>To designate a target, the pilot steers the aircraft in azimuth to place the target along the BFL. Then <strong>UP/DN</strong> on the target designate switch on the left wall of the pilot cockpit is used to slew the target designator along the BFL until it overlays the target. At that point, the target is designated by pressing the target designate switch to <strong>DES</strong>.</p>
<p>After designation, the target designation diamond becomes stabilized to the designated position on the ground, and the AN/AWG-9 is slewed to it for range measurements. The BFL now remains overlaying the designated target while the store impact point pipper and aircraft velocity vector continue to follow aircraft movements. In addition, the HUD now displays the upper and lower solution cues on the BFL.</p>
<p>The pilot should now fly the velocity vector and store impact point over the BFL until the solution cues reach them. The lower solution cue indicates imminent store release when passing the velocity vector, and the pilot should by now be holding the bomb release button depressed to authorize WCS store release. When the upper solution cue reaches the velocity vector, the WCS automatically releases set stores on the condition that the bomb release button is depressed.</p>
<p>The pull-up cue (bracket on the HUD) moves upwards on the HUD towards the velocity vector with decreasing altitude. When it reaches the velocity vector, it indicates that the aircraft is below safe altitude for store release.</p>
<h2 id="computer-initial-point"><a class="header" href="#computer-initial-point">Computer Initial Point</a></h2>
<p>Functionally identical to the Computer Target mode except that a preset initial point (IP) is designated instead of the actual target. The IP is preset before takeoff using data-link or manually by the RIO using the CAP.</p>
<p>The IP waypoint should be a terrain feature expected to be visually identifiable by the pilot even if the target is not.</p>
<p>To set the CAP, the RIO designates the location of the IP waypoint as per the other waypoints in the system. (See CAP heading under AN/AWG-9 in the General Design and Systems Overview section or the Navigation Systems heading in the same section)</p>
<p>The message (function) <strong>IP TO TGT</strong> on the CAP under the SPL category is then used with the prefixes <strong>ALT</strong>, <strong>RNG</strong>, and <strong>BRG</strong> to read out and set the following data points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ALT</strong>: Sets altitude difference of the target relative to the IP waypoint.</li>
<li><strong>RNG</strong>: Sets range to target from the IP waypoint.</li>
<li><strong>BRG</strong>: Sets the bearing to the target from the IP waypoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the pilot designates the IP visually on the HUD, the WCS recalculates the target location using the data set under the <strong>IP TO TGT</strong> function on the CAP, moves the target diamond to that location, and instead displays guidance towards the real target location.</p>
<p>All other functions of this mode are identical to the Computer Target mode.</p>
<h2 id="computer-pilot"><a class="header" href="#computer-pilot">Computer Pilot</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/images/cmptrpilot.png" alt="Computer Pilot" />
The computer pilot mode uses the WCS to continually calculate and display an impact point for the configured store on the HUD.</p>
<p>When selected, the HUD displays the current store impact point in real-time using the pipper (crosshair). The target designation diamond is used when the WCS is configured for rockets and overlays the pipper to indicate that the configured store is out of range when displayed. As in the Computer Target and IP modes, the pull-up cue is used to indicate aircraft below safe store release altitude when at or above the velocity vector.</p>
<p>To correctly engage the desired target, the pilot flies the impact point pipper on the HUD over the target and then depresses the bomb release button.</p>
<p>When using rockets, the pilot should wait until the diamond disappears, indicating that the selected store is within range and then use the control stick trigger to fire the rockets.</p>
<h2 id="manual"><a class="header" href="#manual">Manual</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/images/man.png" alt="Manual" />
The manual air-to-ground mode is used as a backup when the other modes are unavailable.</p>
<p>By principle, it works the same as the Computer Pilot mode in that the pilot should fly the pipper on the HUD over the desired target. The pipper is in this mode not updated by the WCS, however, but instead set at a deflection from the ADL according to desired engagement speed, dive angle, and release altitude.</p>
<p>This is set using the elevation lead panel on the pilot right side vertical panel using weapon engagement tables or by pilot estimation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="zuni-rockets"><a class="header" href="#zuni-rockets">Zuni Rockets</a></h1>
<p>The Zuni 5-inch folding-fin aircraft rocket (FFAR) was developed to replace the high-velocity aircraft rocket (HVAR) of World War 2 vintage. As part of its design, it’s modular and capable of using different warheads as well as different fuzes.</p>
<p>The Zuni rockets are carried in LAU-10 pods, each carrying 4 rockets. The pods can fire in either salvo mode or ripple mode, salvo launching one rocket and ripple all.</p>
<p>The F-14 Tomcat can carry LAU-10 rocket pods on stations 1B, 3, 6, and 8B using TERs, each TER holding up to two pods except one of either 3 or 6 which must only carry one as not to clash with a pod on the adjacent station. The TERs are used to gain separation from the station for safe rocket firing, and the reason for not being able to use three pods on the TERs is that on the glove pylons, the inner TER station would conflict with the main landing gear and on stations 3 and 6 with the fuselage.</p>
<p>The Zuni rockets are set up for launch by the RIO on the armament panel as with bombs, the delivery mode (<strong>DLVY MODE</strong>) switches being used to configure how many pods to activate at a time.</p>

<p>The Mk-80 series bombs are the standard general-purpose bombs used by the US Navy and allies and were first dropped in combat during the Vietnam War. The Mk-82 also has the capability to mount a retardation system using either folding fins or an inflated ballute to brake the bomb after release, allowing them to be dropped at lower altitudes as the dropping aircraft has more time to move away from them. Those versions are called the Mk-82 Snake Eye (fins) and Mk-82AIR (ballute) in DCS.</p>
<p>The F-14 is capable of carrying all the various bombs in the Mk-80s series, 81 through to 84. While the ground attack mission never really materialized for the F-14 in the Navy, it was tested for and cleared to deliver these weapons from the start.</p>
<p>The F-14 uses the Phoenix rails (stations 3-6) and the glove pylons’ lower stations to mount the bombs. The rails themselves can carry all four variants while the 81 to 83 can also be mounted on substations along the sides of the Phoenix rails as well as on TERs on the glove pylons.</p>
<p>All of the Mk-80 bombs have nose fuzes only and should be dropped with the nose (N) fuze setting on the mechanical fuze switch on the RIO armament panel. The Mk-82AIR and Snake Eye variants use the tail fuze wire to enable bomb retardation, meaning that the nose/tail (N/T) mechanical fuze option should be used if retardation is needed.</p>
<p>The total amount of the different bombs carried depends on weapon weight and weapon clearance between the rails; the actual number varies from 18 for the 81s and 82s to just 4 for the 84s as those can only be mounted on the rails themselves. For more info, see the F-14 loadout diagrams.</p>

<p>The GBU (guided bomb unit) are bombs from the Mk-80s series with an attached seeker unit and fin (control) unit converting them into guided precision bombs, and in the case of the GBU-10, 12, 16, and 24 carried by the F-14, laser-guided bombs to be more precise.</p>
<p>When the F-14B gained the ability to mount and use the LANTIRN pod, it was also cleared to carry some of the GBU variants of the Mk-80 series bombs. It can either deliver them onto designation from a self-carried LANTIRN pod or onto a laser designation from another aircraft or ground source.</p>
<p>The GBUs carried are mounted on the Phoenix rails themselves on stations 3-6 as the additional size of a GBU compared to a normal Mk-80 series bomb makes it impossible to use the substations on the rails for those. Each station is capable of carrying one GBU up to the size of the GBU-16. As for the GBU-10 and 24, the 10 can be carried on the front rails (3 and 6) and the 24 on one front rail and one back rail as they need to be carried on opposite sides of the aircraft due to the larger wing assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GBU laser codes are set as per DCS Mission Editor Functions Specific to the HB DCS F-14 or via the kneeboard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mk-20-rockeye"><a class="header" href="#mk-20-rockeye">Mk-20 Rockeye</a></h1>
<p>The Mk-20 Rockeye is a conventional free-fall bomb like the Mk-80 series bombs, but instead of a conventional charge, it carries anti-tank submunitions. The Rockeye contains 247 of these anti-tank submunitions, which are released at a set height using a radar altimeter, the design being that the submunitions are dispersed over a large area for greater effect.</p>
<p>The fuze height itself is set by the ground crew as they’re loaded and can’t be changed by the pilot. To arm the Rockeye correctly, the mechanical fuse should be set to nose (N).</p>
<p>The F-14 can carry up to 10 Mk-20 Rockeyes using the Phoenix rails and substations as well as TERs on the glove pylons.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Additional fuse settings (FMU-140 fuse) pending additional weapon code implementation.</p>

<p>The ADM-141 tactical air-launched decoy (TALD) is a gliding decoy simulating real aircraft using active and passive means. There are several versions of the TALD, examples being a version equipped to launch chaff and another version using a Luneberg lens to increase its cross-section to simulate a larger aircraft.</p>
<p>All versions are pre-programmed before takeoff and are unpowered, gliding through the air on fold-out wings.</p>
<p>The F-14 can carry up to four ADM-141 TALDs, one each on stations 3 through 6, using a TER each to gain separation from the aircraft fuselage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In DCS these currently glide straight ahead until they run out of speed and altitude.</p>

<p>The LANTIRN was adapted for use on the F-14 Tomcats during the 1990s as the F-14’s role started to gravitate towards including the precision strike role.</p>
<p>The version carried on the Heatblur DCS F-14B Tomcat represents the earliest integrations of the LANTIRN, the pod being carried only on station 8B and hardwired to the control panel in the RIO cockpit and to the video input on the TID/VDI.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jester"><a class="header" href="#jester">Jester</a></h1>
<p><em>"You not only get a weapons system officer, folks. You get yourself an
admin officer, you get yourself a flight planner, you get yourself a
watchdog, and he carries a full array of maps and pubs."</em></p>
<p>Flying the Phantom is already a challenge in itself - doing that alone even
more.</p>
<p>Jester is your AI buddy who can take the role of the WSO, so
that you can focus on doing that pilot stuff.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The Jester AI aims to be a functional AI radar intercept officer (RIO) for the Heatblur DCS F-14, enabling a multicrew experience in a single-player (per aircraft) environment.</p>
<p>He is fully integrated into the rear cockpit, controlling nearly all back seat systems with a focus on systems not controllable from the pilot seat. He is also modeled to take into account the limitations of a real human, meaning that his current head position, visual spotting range, and what his hands are doing are fully modeled. When controlling the systems at the RIO seat, he performs all actions that a human RIO would have to do.</p>
<p>To order/control Jester, a command wheel is used for quick access. This wheel is dynamic depending on the current mode selected and also on the current situation. Feedback to the pilot from Jester is via the ICS using a library of recorded audio, simulating the experience of having a RIO actually talking to you. Apart from acknowledging orders, he will also communicate pertinent information to the pilot depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Finally, in a multiplayer environment, a RIO joining a Tomcat in flight will find all controls at the rear seat in the position where Jester left them. If the human RIO disconnects, Jester will resume control of the systems in the configuration the human player left them.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functionality"><a class="header" href="#functionality">Functionality</a></h1>
<p><img src="jester/../img/menu.png" alt="Menu" /></p>
<p>The Jester menu is by default brought up using <code>A</code> and selection of a menu item (1 to 8) is done using <code>CTRL + 1 to 8</code>. These key commands can be changed or set to a controller using the Jester category under F-14 Pilot in the DCS keybinds. The key commands for the menu petals are designed to be mapped to an eight-way hat on a game controller. Additionally, it’s possible to use the viewing angle in the cockpit to select a petal while holding the Jester menu keybind for more than 0.5 seconds. This can be enabled or disabled in the F-14 options.</p>
<p>Pictured above is the main Jester menu, which contains all the different available contextual menus. The first press of the Jester menu command normally brings up one of the contextual menus depending on the mode and situation the aircraft is in. For example, air-to-air mode while airborne lands the user directly into the BEYOND VISUAL RANGE - RADAR menu, while airborne and in air-to-ground mode brings up the AIR TO GROUND - WEAPONS menu. In addition, the take-off and landing modes have their own contextual menus only available when in those modes.</p>
<p>After pressing the Jester menu command and landing in the relevant contextual menu, another press of the same command then brings up the main Jester menu, enabling selection of a different contextual menu than the automatic one.</p>
<p>The normal sequence of pressing the Jester menu command (defaulting to <code>A</code>) is thus: Menu OFF -&gt; Contextual menu depending on mode and situation -&gt; Main Menu -&gt; Menu OFF.</p>
<p>From these menus, it is then possible to control the various systems at the RIO seat. Depending on previous commands, options in the different contextual menus might change, and some systems use the petals of the menu as inputs/keypads to set frequencies and other numbers in those systems.</p>
<p>For example, it is possible to tell Jester to set a waypoint in the navigational systems, but it will require a lot of consecutive key presses. As a shortcut, it is possible to have him enter a waypoint from a map marker set in the F10 view. To help with selecting a marker in this case, the menu will show the user time since created and the name entered for the marker.</p>
<p>In the case of a system needing to select a specific symbol, like choosing a target on the TID to lock in STT, the menu will allow the pilot to tell Jester to either lock the closest target, the closest hostile target, and so on. Additionally, it is possible to specify a specific symbol/track to look using an azimuth/range system.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jester is also able to read out the startup checklist, helping the pilot to cold start the F-14 in the assisted startup detailed further down.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="navigation"><a class="header" href="#navigation">Navigation</a></h1>

<p><img src="jester/../img/map_2.jpg" alt="real_life_crew_with_map" /></p>
<p>Navigation with Jester revolves around managing turn points for two flight plans:
the Primary Flight Plan and the Secondary Flight Plan. Both can be edited and followed
by Jester in the same manner, although Primary Flight Plan is considered the main
one and the Secondary Flight Plan serves as a backup.</p>
<h2 id="flight-plan"><a class="header" href="#flight-plan">Flight Plan</a></h2>
<p>A flight plan consists of multiple turn points. They can be inserted, deleted or
edited by the player through the UI, map or mission editor.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_edit_turn_points.jpg" alt="Edit Turn Points" /></p>
<p>If the mission has assigned the aircraft a series of waypoints through the
mission editor, this will be available by default as the Primary Flight Plan.</p>
<h3 id="map-marker"><a class="header" href="#map-marker">Map Marker</a></h3>
<p>Using the <kbd>F10</kbd> map view in DCS, players can create named markers on
the map simply by double clicking the desired position after selecting <strong>Mark
Label</strong> at the top row in the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/dcs_map_markers.jpg" alt="Create Map Markers" /></p>
<p>Through the UI, these map markers can then be imported as turn points to the
flight plan.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_map_markers_ui.jpg" alt="Select Map Marker" /></p>
<h3 id="tune-asset"><a class="header" href="#tune-asset">Tune Asset</a></h3>
<p>The UI offers a list of nearby assets, such as ships, tankers or ground stations.</p>
<p>Their current position can be imported as turn point directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For moving assets like tankers, their actual position might vary from the
planned coordinates. Use TACAN or ADF for more precise navigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tune-airfield"><a class="header" href="#tune-airfield">Tune Airfield</a></h3>
<p>Similar to tuning for assets, the UI provides a list of nearby airfields to
navigate to.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_tune_airfields.jpg" alt="Tune Airfields" /></p>
<h3 id="enter-coordinates"><a class="header" href="#enter-coordinates">Enter Coordinates</a></h3>
<p>One way to add a turn point is by entering the corresponding LAT/LON through the
UI.</p>
<p>The format is <code>H DD MM H DDD MM</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>where <code>H</code> represents the hemisphere (<code>N</code> or <code>S</code> for latitude and <code>E</code> or <code>W</code>
for longitude);</li>
<li><code>D</code> signifies Degrees (<code>00</code> to <code>89</code> for latitude and <code>000</code> to <code>179</code> for
longitude);</li>
<li>and <code>M</code> stands for Minutes (<code>00</code> to <code>59</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>A valid example could be <code>N 45 32 E 047 12</code> or <code>S 05 55 W 105 00</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Spaces are optional, <code>N4532E04712</code> is also valid.</p>

<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_enter_latlon.jpg" alt="Enter Coordinates" /></p>
<h2 id="operation-2"><a class="header" href="#operation-2">Operation</a></h2>
<p>Jester navigates by utilizing a technique called <strong>leapfrogging</strong>. The aircraft
only provides a single slot to memorize a waypoint (called <strong>TGT 2</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="planned-route"><a class="header" href="#planned-route">Planned Route</a></h3>
<p>When leapfrogging, <strong>TGT 2</strong> always indicates the next turn point of the current
active flight plan. As the aircraft approaches this turn point (±2 nautical
miles), Jester will automatically update TGT 2 to the next turn point in the
sequence.</p>
<p>This enables the pilot to follow the entire route of the flight plan by
selecting NAV COMP on the Navigation Function Selector Panel and following the
corresponding indication on the HSI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_hsi.jpg" alt="HSI" /></p>
<h3 id="divert"><a class="header" href="#divert">Divert</a></h3>
<p>Besides following the flight plan, Jester is capable of diverting to a different
unplanned turn point using <strong>TGT 1</strong>.</p>
<p>Through the UI, players can switch between the diversion (TGT1) and flight plan
(TGT2) at any time.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_divert_option.jpg" alt="Divert Option" /></p>
<h3 id="pause--resume-route"><a class="header" href="#pause--resume-route">Pause &amp; Resume Route</a></h3>
<p>An active flight plan is indicated by the UI using an asterisk <code>*</code> next to the
current turn point.</p>
<p>Automatic turn point switching can be temporarily disabled per turn point using
the <strong>Holding</strong> option. Turn points designated for holding are marked
with a <code>h</code>.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_resume_flightplan.jpg" alt="Turn Point Modifiers" /></p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_holding.jpg" alt="Turn Point Holding" /></p>
<p>When a flight plan has been paused, for example, because the pilot diverted to a
different point (using TGT 1), it can be reactivated through the UI again by
using the <strong>Go To/Resume</strong> option.</p>
<p>This also offers the possibility to skip turn points by jumping directly to any
turn point in its sequence, as well as returning to previous points or resuming
from a point designated for holding.</p>
<h2 id="tacan"><a class="header" href="#tacan">TACAN</a></h2>
<p>The TACAN equipment can be operated by both crew members independently and then
swapped between Pilot and WSO by using the <strong>Command Button</strong> on the panel.</p>
<p>Further, Jester is able to tune directly to any TACAN capable asset or ground
station.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_tacan_ground_station.jpg" alt="Tune TACAN Ground Station" /></p>
<p>This also allows the pilot to set up Jesters TACAN panel with a secondary setup
to then switch between both with a single click on the Command Button.</p>
<h2 id="uhf"><a class="header" href="#uhf">UHF</a></h2>
<p>The UHF radio is duplicated between both crew members and can be operated
independently. Using the <strong>Command Button</strong> allows the pilot to swap control
between their and Jesters setup. This enables the pilot to setup two
configurations and then swap between them fast with a single button press.</p>
<p>Jester is able to tune the radio directly to any nearby asset or ATC to enable
and open a communication channel conveniently and quick. Via ADF, this can also
be used for navigation.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_uhf_tune_atc.jpg" alt="Tune UHF ATC" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h1>
<p>Jesters assistance for combat situations is generally divided into options on
the Jester Wheel, whenever not in a high action environment yet, and a smart
<strong>Context Action</strong> for use during situations that require acting quick, such as
during a fight.</p>
<h2 id="context-action"><a class="header" href="#context-action">Context Action</a></h2>
<p>The context command (by default <kbd>V</kbd>) allows for intuitive cooperation
and exchange between Pilot and WSO based on the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pave Spike - TGT FIND selected on the Delivery Mode Knob</li>
<li>Dive Toss - DT or DL selected on the Delivery Mode Knob</li>
<li>Dogfight - CAGE mode</li>
<li>Beyond Visual Range - other</li>

</div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="radar"><a class="header" href="#radar">Radar</a></h1>
<p>During flight, Jester will constantly operate the radar and search for contacts.</p>
<p>In certain situations, such as during landing, on the ground or when performing
AAR, the radar will be in Standby mode. This can also be commanded manually by
selecting <code>Radar &gt; Operation &gt; Go Cold</code> in the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_operation_options.jpg" alt="Select Operation Mode" /></p>
<p>When using the radar, Jester generally differentiates between two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan</li>
<li>Lock</li>
</ul>
<p>The phases are commanded and switched by the pilot using the Context Action.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jester will behave differently during a dogfight, indicated by the
pilot entering CAGE mode.</p>
<h2 id="scan"><a class="header" href="#scan">Scan</a></h2>
<p>This is the default phase Jester will be in. He will automatically point the
antenna at different altitudes and ranges in order to scan the entire space
ahead of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Jester will automatically identify any new contact and call them out to the
pilot.</p>
<p>If desired, the player can request Jester to perform an IFF challenge manually
at any time through the UI (this action can also be bound directly to a key).
Should the situation require, the player can manually set a zone for Jester to
scan outside of his regular pattern through the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/f4_jester_scan_zones.jpg" alt="Select Scan Zone" /></p>
<p>He will then scan this zone for a while first before proceeding back to his
regular pattern.</p>
<p>Likewise, the display range and scan type (wide or narrow) to be used during
scanning can be selected as well.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_select_display.jpg" alt="Select Display Settings" /></p>
<h3 id="target-selection"><a class="header" href="#target-selection">Target Selection</a></h3>
<p>Whenever a bandit becomes a threat (closer than 25 nm), Jester automatically
<strong>selects</strong> the target by moving and keeping the cursor on the corresponding
radar return.</p>
<p>The player can command target selection at any time by using the context
actions. This way, targets outside of the threat-range can be selected as well.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_scan_cursor_on_target.jpg" alt="Cursor On Target" /></p>
<p>Whenever a target within threat-range is selected, Jester will <strong>focus</strong> them,
stop the regular search pattern, automatically enter Narrow View and point the
antenna at the target in order to maximize tracking quality.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_focus.jpg" alt="Focussed On Target" /></p>
<p>This mode can be understood as <em>"Track While Scan"</em>, where Jester keeps the
radar on a specific contact, while still scanning the surrounding space,
identifying and calling out any new contact spotted.</p>
<p>Context actions only allow selection of hostile aircraft. Should the situation
require, other targets can always be focused directly through the UI instead.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_ui_focus.jpg" alt="Focussed On Target" /></p>
<p>Automatic target selection and focus behavior can be deactivated in the UI. This
can be useful if flying through a hostile zone, expecting contacts, while not
wanting to engage them and instead keep an overview and continuing the scan
pattern. For example when having an escort of fighters that will take care of
the bandits instead.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_operation_options.jpg" alt="Deactivate Auto-Focus" /></p>

</div>
<p>Unless only a single bandit shows on the screen, locking via ▄ (long) requires
prior target selection. Either automatically through Jester or by using •
(short). In an ambiguous situation, pressing ▄ (long) will first select the
target with highest priority.</p>
<p>Pressing •• (double) will reset the currently selected target and return Jester
to his standard behavior of automatically selecting the highest threat, if any.
Should one desire to ignore a target within threat range, automatic target focus
has to be deactivated through the UI first. •• (double) can then be pressed to
deselect the target.</p>
<h2 id="lock"><a class="header" href="#lock">Lock</a></h2>
<p>During a lock, Jester works the radar to keep the lock as long as possible.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_locked.jpg" alt="Locked Target" /></p>
<p>The UI also allows selecting a target to lock manually without using context
action.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_ui_lock.jpg" alt="Lock Target Manually" /></p>

<h2 id="dogfight"><a class="header" href="#dogfight">Dogfight</a></h2>
<p>A within-visual-range situation is entered by the pilot activating CAGE mode.</p>
<p>In this mode, the radar is automatically boresighted forward and Jester will be
able to lock a return.</p>
<p>Further, the pilot can enter CAA mode where the system will automatically lock
any close contact.</p>

</div>
<p>To lock a target in CAGE mode, press • (short) or ▄ (long) once ready. Jester
will now automatically lock the first target return he can identify. If no
target could be found within a few seconds, Jester will abort the process and •
or ▄ have to be used again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Targets have to be within 5 degrees of the boresight or a lock attempt
would result in a bad lock. When Jester does not lock the return yet, it is
because he is waiting for the pilot to put it within that zone first.</p>

<p>Dropping ordnance on ground targets with Jester consists of two phases.
Initially, Jester has to prepare for the attack by entering corresponding data
into the panels. For most modes, the attack run itself can be executed by the
pilot alone. However, for Dive Toss and Dive Laydown modes, Jester must lock the
ground return using the radar.</p>
<h2 id="preparation"><a class="header" href="#preparation">Preparation</a></h2>
<p>To prepare a bombing run, both pilot and WSO have to enter several settings
throughout the cockpit.</p>
<p>For Jester, this includes the WRCS panel, such as the <strong>Release Range</strong>,
<strong>Target Altitude</strong> or <strong>Release Advance</strong>, as well as the LABS angles and
timers.</p>
<p>To prepare Jester for a bombing run, use the
<a href="jester/combat/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Computer</a> tool and transfer the solution
by utilizing the <strong>Tell Jester</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jester_bombing_table.jpg" alt="Tell Jester UI" /></p>
<p>Once activated, Jester will do his part in preparing the aircraft for the
desired attack.</p>
<h2 id="dive-toss"><a class="header" href="#dive-toss">Dive Toss</a></h2>
<p>During a Dive Toss or Dive Laydown attack, indicated by DT or DL selected on the
Delivery Mode Knob, the <strong>Context Action</strong> can be used to command Jester to lock
the ground return after placing the nose on the target. A subsequent press will
unlock the target again.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jester_dive_toss_prepare.jpg" alt="Pipper on Target" /></p>
<p>This way, ground targets can be attacked effectively during a dive. The pilot
places the reticle on the target, commands Jester to lock the return and then
pulls up while holding down the Bomb Button. Weapons will be released
automatically shortly after.</p>

<p>During the entire flight, Jester will assist the pilot in all situations.</p>
<p>He will call out bandits during a dogfight and give the pilot steering tips.
Jester might tell the pilot in which direction to evade when attacked by a
missile, make him aware of any friendly traffic spotted or also simply when the
AVTR cassette is full.</p>
<p>While lacking a fuel gauge in his cockpit, he will observe the clock and the
pilots flying style to remind him about checking the fuel level or consumption
when forgetting to leave the Fuel Dump switch activated.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_fuel_check.jpg" alt="Jester Fuel Check" /></p>
<p>Jester is able to assess and report battle damage to a certain degree and much
more.</p>
<h2 id="iceman"><a class="header" href="#iceman">Iceman</a></h2>
<p><img src="jester/../img/pilot.png" alt="Pilot" /></p>
<p>In addition to Jester, or rather, as a subset of the Jester AI, the Heatblur DCS F-14 also has Iceman, a basic autopilot/AI. This is intended for use in single-player where a player might jump between the front and back seats to control both positions and enables a basic autopilot controllable from the back seat using the same methodology as the Jester controls from the front seat.</p>
<p>The basic functionality is that when the player switches to the RIO seat, Iceman takes control of the current heading and altitude. The, now Iceman, menu then allows the player to set heading, altitude, and speed. Heading and altitude can be set relative to a target or as absolutes not referencing an external target.</p>
<h2 id="assisted-startup"><a class="header" href="#assisted-startup">Assisted Startup</a></h2>
<p><img src="jester/../img/startup.png" alt="Startup" /></p>
<p>For aircraft cold start, Jester can either perform his checklist like a real RIO would, or he can also help the pilot with an assisted startup in which he reads the pilot’s checklist to him while starting.</p>
<p>To access the normal, unassisted startup, select startup, Jester will then go through his checklist. He will at times ask the pilot if he has completed certain checks or ask for specific tests; this is answered via the Jester menu using the options appearing there. For example, he will start by asking for a comms check, which is answered via the Jester menu. Note that after engine startup and EMERG GEN Master test, he will ask for what INS alignment to go for, select this via the Jester menu as well.</p>
<p>To access the assisted startup, select assisted start on the Jester menu. Jester will now read out the checklist to the pilot and highlight the relevant indicators and switches during startup. Use the Jester menu to tell Jester when a check/step is complete.</p>
<h2 id="takeoff-and-landing-assistance"><a class="header" href="#takeoff-and-landing-assistance">Takeoff and Landing Assistance</a></h2>
<p>When taking off, Jester will report key values for the airspeed, indicating to
the pilot when to initiate the roll.</p>
<p>By default, Jester will assist the player during landing by giving altitude
callouts, similar as seen in civilian aviation. This way, the pilot can better
estimate the current position, especially given the reduced forward visibility
in the Phantom.</p>

<p>This chapter contains standard procedures for operating the F-4E Phantom II.</p>
<p>The aircrew procedures through the <a href="procedures/taxi.html#before-taxi">Before Taxi</a> paragraph
are separated into individual procedures for the <strong>pilot</strong> and <strong>weapon system
officer</strong>. These separate procedures allow the individual crew-member to perform
the checks without requiring him to read the checks performed by the other
crew-member. The remaining procedures are combined and are coded for applicable
crew-member action. Items coded <strong>(P-RIO)</strong> are applicable to both the pilot and
weapon system officer. Items coded <strong>(RIO)</strong> are applicable to the weapon system
officer only, and items <strong>not coded</strong> are applicable to the pilot only.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Real procedures and checklists evolved over time. The procedures provided
in this manual are based on a time range around the 80s and tailored to our
simulation of the Phantom specifically. Procedures provided in other resources
may differ slightly.</p>

<em>A right front view of an F-4 Phantom II aircraft taking off

<h2 id="normal-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#normal-takeoff">Normal Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>The slats out-flaps down position is recommended for all
takeoffs. After line-up on the runway and completing
necessary pre-takeoff checks, engines can be run to 85%
with brakes held and nose gear steering engaged to ensure
nose gear alignment. With both engines
operating in excess of 85% and the brakes locked, there is
a possibility of rotating the tires on the wheel rims or
skidding the tires. Check for normal rpm response and
approximate readings of 450°C EGT, 4000 pph fuel flow, ¼
nozzles, and 30-40 psi oil pressure. After releasing brakes,
advance both throttles rapidly to full military power and
check rpm, exhaust temperatures and nozzle position.
WSO check the ramps fully retracted. If an afterburner
takeoff is desired, shift the throttles into the afterburner
detent and advance full forward for max thrust. Maintain
directional control with nose gear steering or rudder as
required. The rudder becomes effective for steering at
approximately 70 knots. Wheel braking should not be used
for directional control during takeoff roll. Nose gear
steering should be disengaged when rudder steering
becomes effective. If it becomes necessary to re-engage
nose gear steering at the higher speeds, rudder pedals
should be returned to neutral prior to engagement since
rudder displacement necessary for rudder steering will
generally be excessive for nose gear steering. Sufficient aft
stick should be applied prior to nose wheel liftoff speed to
attain the desired pitch attitude. As the nose rises, pitch
attitude must be controlled to maintain a 10° to 12° (first
pitch mark) nose high attitude for aircraft fly-off. Caution
must be exercised to preclude over-rotation due to
excessive aft stick rate or an extended takeoff roll due to
late lift-off. The basic takeoff attitude should be held
during acceleration and transition to a clean
configuration. Trim change and control action during this
period are normal. The AUX AIR DOORS, WHEELS, and
MASTER CAUTION lights may illuminate momentarily
as the landing gear and flaps are retracted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: Rapid full aft movement of the stick between
takeoff airspeed and 30 knots below takeoff
airspeed may result in the stabilator hitting the
runway with the possibility of stabilator actuator
damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="procedures/takeoff/../../img/takeoff.jpg" alt="Takeoff" /></p>
<h2 id="no-flap-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#no-flap-takeoff">No-Flap Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>No-flap takeoffs are not recommended. However, if it is
determined that no-flap takeoffs must be performed to
satisfy mission requirements, aircrews should be aware
that takeoff roll and airspeed will be increased and: the
takeoff attitude will be slightly steeper. Stabilator
effectiveness is considerably increased and extreme
caution must be exercised to prevent over-rotation which
could result in the stabilator striking the runway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Due to increased stabilator authority with the
flaps up, aircraft rotation can be initiated at
lower than normal airspeeds and over-rotation is
a definite possibility. If it appears that
over-rotation is occurring, positive control
movement (stick forward) must be taken to
prevent the stabilator from contacting the
runway and/or loss of aircraft control.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="minimum-run--heavy-gross-weight-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#minimum-run--heavy-gross-weight-takeoff">Minimum Run / Heavy Gross Weight Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>A minimum run/heavy gross weight takeoff (aircraft over
55,500 pounds) is accomplished in the same manner as a
normal takeoff with the following exceptions: It is
recommended that all minimum run/heavy gross weight
takeoffs be made with afterburner. During the takeoff-run,
full aft stick must be applied prior to reaching 80 knots. As
the aircraft starts to rotate, the stick should be adjusted to
maintain 10° to 12° pitch attitude for aircraft fly-off. The
possibility of a main landing gear tire failure increases
with an extended takeoff ground run under heavy gross
weight conditions. Nose wheel liftoff speed and takeoff
speed is increased during heavy gross weight conditions.
In the event of an aborted takeoff, it must be remembered
that stopping distance is greatly increased as abort speed
increases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: With a combination of light gross weight and aft
CG, the minimum run takeoff technique (i.e., full
aft stick prior to reaching 80 knots) produces
rapid pitch rates during nose rotation. This
combination can exist when the radar package
and nose gun (or equivalent ballast) are not
installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="crosswind-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#crosswind-takeoff">Crosswind Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>Under crosswind conditions, the aircraft tends to weather
vane into the wind. The weathervaning tendency can be
easily controlled with nose gear steering. As forward speed
increases, weathervaning tendency decreases. At speeds
above 70 knots rudder effectiveness will normally be
sufficient to maintain directional control. After the nose is
lifted to takeoff attitude, the aircraft will have a tendency
to drift toward the downwind side of the runway.
Therefore, when a long time period is expected between
nose lift-off and aircraft fly-off, or when the crosswind
effect is particularly severe, nose lift-off can be delayed
accordingly. Under normal operational conditions this
action should not be required. As the aircraft leaves the
ground, it should be crabbed into the wind, wings level, to
maintain runway alignment. Takeoff in gusty crosswind
or severe wake turbulence conditions can result in an
abrupt wing low attitude at or near lift-off. When these
conditions are anticipated, use higher than computed
takeoff speed to provide additional lateral control after
lift-off.</p>
<h2 id="after-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#after-takeoff">After Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>When the aircraft is definitely airborne:</p>
<p>Retract the gear. Check that the landing gear position indicators
display the word UP, and that the landing gear
handle warning light is out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: The landing gear and gear doors should be
completely up and locked before the gear limit
airspeed of 250 knots is reached, otherwise,
excessive air loads may damage the landing gear
mechanism and prevent subsequent operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Set slats and flaps to NORM.
Check that slat flap indicators display IN and UP.
Rudder jumps may occur during flap retraction
with a lateral stick input. If an audible
(noticeable in head phones) chattering associated
with slat flap and utility hydraulic pressure
indicator fluctuating in unison occurs during
slats flaps retraction, maintain airspeed below
250 knots and cycle slats flaps. If slat chatter
occurs during maneuvering at altitude, it may
require opposite slats positioning from where
chatter occurs. If chatter persists, extend slats
flaps and land as soon as practical. If cycling (slats
repositioning) eliminates chatter, continue
mission and make an appropriate entry in AF
Form 781.</p>
<h2 id="climb"><a class="header" href="#climb">Climb</a></h2>
<p>A simplified climb can be made by maintaining a 10° to 12°
(first pitch mark) nose high attitude until reaching 350
knots and then vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350
knots until reaching cruise Mach/TAS. Vary pitch as
necessary to maintain cruise Mach/TAS until reaching
cruise altitude. A simplified Maximum thrust climb, at
normal gross weights, can be made by maintaining a 10°
to 12° nose high attitude until reaching 350 knots and then
vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350 knots until
reaching Mach 0.9. Vary the pitch attitude as necessary to
maintain Mach 0.9 until reaching cruise altitude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 During the climb, it may be necessary to place the
antenna selector switch to the LWR position to
maintain ground communication.</p>

<h2 id="rig-check"><a class="header" href="#rig-check">Rig Check</a></h2>
<p>A rig check shall be performed if an out-of-rig or
unintentional asymmetric load condition is suspected and
before maximum-performance/high-AOA maneuvering.
With all axes of the stab aug engaged, center the rear
cockpit ball and check that aircraft does not roll more than
2°/second with ailerons and spoilers trimmed neutral. Ifa
large amount of lateral trim (equivalent to more than 1
inch aileron down at 350 knots) is required to prevent roll,

<h2 id="descent--before-landing"><a class="header" href="#descent--before-landing">Descent / Before Landing</a></h2>
<p>The Descent/Before Landing check should be
accomplished above 10,000 feet AGL and at a time when
mission/flight demands are not critical. Prior to
performing a rapid descent, the windshield and canopy
surfaces should be preheated to prevent the formation of
frost or fog. If it becomes necessary to dump fuel during a
descent, thrust settings in excess of 85% rpm may be
required to ensure rapid inflight dumping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to limited forward visibility, it is advisable to raise
the seat up before entering the pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="landing-technique"><a class="header" href="#landing-technique">Landing Technique</a></h2>
<p>For a normal landing, fly the pattern as illustrated in
figure. Enter the pattern as local policy dictates.</p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_pattern.jpg" alt="Landing Pattern" /></p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_pattern_2.jpg" alt="Landing Pattern 2" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: If high angles of attack develop during the turn
to downwind, the rudder should be used as a
primary means of rollout since adverse yaw may
be introduced by the use of ailerons. Altitude may
be insufficient for recovery if uncontrolled flight
is encountered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoid buffet throughout the landing pattern. Adjust
power, as necessary, to attain allowable gear lowering
airspeed. Extend landing gear and slats and flaps in level
flight on downwind. Actual flap extension may not occur
until slowing to 210 knots. Ensure slats out-flaps down
prior to initiating turn to base leg. The optimum indicated
AOA for approach is 19.2 units, and is adequate for all
gross weight and normal slat flap configurations. The
AOA aural tone system provides an audible cue to
maintain an on-speed approach (steady tone played at medium pitch).
During very gusty flight
conditions, full aileron may not be sufficient to correct a
wing low condition. When landing in gusty or crosswind
conditions, with wake turbulence, with high internal fuel
load (aft CG), or with an abnormal configuration (slats in,
asymmetric slats or slats partially extended), a 17 unit
AOA approach is recommended. A transition to ON
SPEED and a flared landing will reduce the touchdown
speed. The AOA indexer and aural tone indications
remain unaffected. Establish and maintain On Speed
angle-of-attack on the base leg or final approach,
adjusting pitch attitude to maintain AOA and power to
maintain desired glide slope/rate of descent. Cross-check
computed airspeed and On Speed AOA to detect gross
errors in AOA. When the aircraft reaches 20 to 30 feet
altitude above the ground, ground effect will tend to rotate
the aircraft in the nose-down direction. Maintaining pitch
attitude will result in transition to a slightly slow
indication at touch-down which is desired. Flying a 2 1/2°
to 3° glide slope will produce an approach rate of descent
of about 700 feet per minute. Sink rate at touchdown will
be appreciably reduced by ground effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: Flying a steeper than normal final approach or
not maintaining pitch attitude when entering
ground effect, can cause touchdown sink rates to
exceed the design limit of the main landing gear
struts.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- (Refer to section V for touchdown sink
rates vs gross weight limitations.) -->
<p>At touchdown, reduce power to idle and deploy drag chute.
Use full aft stick to help decelerate. Use rudder and
ailerons for directional control down to 70 knots then use
differential braking. Nose gear steering should not be
required for directional control in light crosswind
conditions. However, if rudder, aileron, and/or
differential braking are not effective in maintaining
directional control, use nose gear steering as required.
Engage nose gear steering only with the rudder at or near
neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Nose gear steering malfunctions can cause loss of
directional control if engaged at high ground
speed; therefore, it should not be engaged above
taxi speed unless required to maintain directional
control during crosswind landing conditions. If no
response is noted or unscheduled steering
responses are detected when engaging nose gear
steering, disengage immediately and do not
reengage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During braking, cycling of the anti-skid system can be
detected by a change in longitudinal deceleration. Cycling
may not be apparent when braking at high speed
immediately after landing, with drag chute failure, or
with a wet or icy runway. Do not misinterpret this as
anti-skid failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Drag chute should not be dropped on the runway or a taxiway.
A popular technique is to leave it on the side of a taxiway
by appropriately orienting the aircraft, inflating the chute
with the engines and then releasing it in the desired direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="no-flap-landing"><a class="header" href="#no-flap-landing">No-Flap Landing</a></h2>
<p>Refer to <a href="procedures/landing/../../emergency_procedures/overwiew.html">EMERGENCY PROCEDURES</a></p>
<!-- TODO: add specific procedure link -->
<h2 id="short-field-landing"><a class="header" href="#short-field-landing">Short Field Landing</a></h2>
<p>Short field landings require that normal final approach
procedures be followed with precision and the aircraft be
touched down as close to the end of the runway as safety
permits. Full aft stick throughout the landing roll
increases both aerodynamic drag and wheel brake
effectiveness. Apply maximum braking by fully
depressing the brake pedals to the pedal stops as soon as
the nose gear is on the ground and nose gear steering is
engaged. Nose gear steering should be used to maintain
runway alignment and supplemented with differential
braking only if required.</p>
<p>Operation on the AM-2 aluminum mat is similar to that
conducted on a concrete runway of equivalent size.
Arrestment should be regarded as an emergency
procedure. However, since the aircraft is fully suitable for
arrested landings, extremely adverse meteorological or
operational conditions may warrant consideration of
landing into a suitable approach-end arresting gear.</p>
<h2 id="crosswind-landing-dry-runway"><a class="header" href="#crosswind-landing-dry-runway">Crosswind Landing (Dry Runway)</a></h2>
<p>Carefully compensate for crosswind in the traffic pattern
to guard against undershooting or overshooting the final
turn. Fly the final approach course with the aircraft
ground track properly aligned with the runway. The
crosswind may be compensated for either by using the
wing low method, the crab method, or a combination of the
two. When using the wing low method, the ARI can be
overpowered by use of the rudder pedals or the ARI can be
disengaged by pulling the rudder trim circuit breaker. If
the crab method is employed, the aircraft heading should
be aligned with the runway just prior to touchdown. After
touchdown, use rudder, aileron and spoiler, and nose gear
steering as required to maintain directional control.
Crosswind effect on the aircraft is not severe; however,
rudder, differential braking, and/or nose gear steering
must be used as required to maintain alignment with the
runway. Use of the drag chute intensifies the weather
vane effect for any given deployment condition. The
weather vane effect increases as the forward velocity of
the aircraft decreases, therefore, if the drag chute is to be
used, it should be used at the initial portion rather than
the latter portion of the landing roll. This also assures use
of the drag chute in the speed region where it is most
effective. If the drag chute is used and excessive
weathervaning is encountered, jettison drag chute. Since
the nose gear will rapidly assume a position relative to the
rudder pedals, nose gear steering should be initiated with
the rudder pedals at or near the neutral position. For this
reason the use of nose gear steering is advocated early in
the landing roll rather than at a time when large amounts
of rudder are required to hold the aircraft aligned on the
runway. Keep in mind that only really tiny amounts of nose gear steering should be used as there is
a high risk of a nose gear steering hardover. The most important aspect of directional control
under crosswind conditions is keeping the aircraft
precisely aligned with the runway rather than trying to
correct back to the runway centerline after it has deviated.</p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_crosswind.jpg" alt="Crosswind Landing Guide" /></p>
<h2 id="wet-or-icy-runway-landing"><a class="header" href="#wet-or-icy-runway-landing">Wet or Icy Runway Landing</a></h2>
<p>Wet or icy runway conditions pose severe problems in
directional control and braking effectiveness. On wet
runways, these problems are primarily the result of
hydroplaning where the tire rides on a thin layer of water
and produces little or no traction. The probability of
hydroplaning increases with increased water depth,
increased ground speed, decreased tire pressure and
decreased tire tread depth and is also affected by runway
surface texture and tire tread design. Hydroplaning can
occur on runways which appear only damp if severe
braking is applied at high speeds. Hydroplaning and glare
ice present essentially the same problems. Due to the
reduced directional control, all landings on a wet or icy
runway should be made utilizing a crosswind technique.
Refer to the Crosswind Landing Guide (figure 2-7) to
determine the advisability of making an approach-end
engagement. The pilot should also consider the
desirability of delaying the landing to permit the runway
to dry or diverting to another field. Gross weight should be
reduced to the minimum practicable. Plan the pattern to
be well established on final with the aircraft tracking
straight down the runway centerline with an ON SPEED
indication. Use a wings - level crab, if required, to
maintain the track. Establish the rate of descent at 800
fpm (slightly steeper than normal) and plan to touchdown
on the centerline within the first 500 feet. Make a firm
touchdown (500-600 fpm) while maintaining the
wings-level crab. Immediately after touchdown retard the
throttles to idle. Do not attempt to align the aircraft
heading with the runway as this will result in a drift off
the runway if the aircraft is sliding or hydroplaning.
Maintain full forward stick to increase nosewheel
traction. As wheel cornering capability overcomes
aerodynamic effects the aircraft will align itself with the
runway. Do not attempt to hasten this process. When the
aircraft heading is aligned with the runway centerline,
deploy the drag chute. Be prepared to jettison the drag
chute if the weathervaning effect interferes with
maintaining the track straight down the runway
centerline. Nose gear steering is the primary method of
directional control and should be utilized as early as
possible. Nose gear steering should be engaged only with
the rudder pedals at or near neutral. When directional
control is firmly established utilize maximum anti-skid
braking. Brake pedals must be fully depressed to achieve
maximum deceleration. At high speeds the braking
potential will be very low and little deceleration will be
felt. As braking potential increases with decreasing speed,
the anti-skid system will increase deceleration
accordingly. Unless the pilot is familiar with the variables
in braking potential, the low deceleration at high speed
may be mistakenly interpreted as a brake or anti-skid
failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: Rubber deposits on the last 2000 feet of wet
runway make directional control a difficult
problem even at very low speeds. Braking should
be started in sufficient time so as not to require
excessive braking on the last portion of the
runway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heavy-gross-weight-landing"><a class="header" href="#heavy-gross-weight-landing">Heavy Gross Weight Landing</a></h2>
<p>The heavy gross weight landing pattern is the same as the
basic pattern shown in figure 2-6 with the exception that
it should be expanded slightly to compensate for the lower
maneuvering capability of the heavy gross weight aircraft
at low speeds. As in the normal pattern, an on-speed
indication on the indexer will provide the optimum angle
of attack and airspeed for the aircraft in the landing
configuration for both level flight and maneuvering flight.
Refer to Performance Data, appendix A, for airspeed
versus gross weight at approach AOA.</p>
<h2 id="go-around"><a class="header" href="#go-around">Go-Around</a></h2>
<p>Any decision to go around should be made as early as
possible. When the decision to go around is made,
smoothly increase thrust to military (afterburner if
required). Do not attempt to rotate the nose or stop
rate-of-descent until adequate airspeed is built up.
Continue to use the on speed indication as the optimum
angle of attack until level flight is attained. As airspeed
increases, establish normal takeoff attitude, retract gear
when a positive rate of climb is established, retract slats
and flaps at a safe airspeed (180 knots minimum) and go
around. Rudder jumps may occur during flap retraction
with lateral stick input. For a closed pattern, accomplish
a climbing 180° turn to roll out on downwind at 220 to 250
knots. Refer to Go-Around, figure 2-8. During go-around
a rapid trim change is required to preclude high forward
stick forces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Do not exceed 18 units AOA during go-around
with gear retracted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="touch-and-go"><a class="header" href="#touch-and-go">Touch-And-Go</a></h2>
<p>After making a normal approach and touchdown,
smoothly advance throttles to full military power. Apply
aft stick until the nose rotates 10° to 12° of pitch attitude
maintaining this attitude until the aircraft is flying. When
definitely airborne retract the gear, followed by the flaps
as the aircraft accelerates through 180 knots minimum.</p>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Alarm Check</td><td>The KY-28 will perform an automatic alarm check when the mode switch is set to C and the power knob is set to On. The check will continue for about 2 seconds after power is applied. During this time a steady, unbroken 1200 Hz tone is heard in the headsets. Upon successful completion of the check, the 1200 Hz tone is interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>Alarm Check Failure</td><td>Note: If the KY-28 fails the alarm check, the power knob must be set to OFF and the mode switch to P (plain) to enable conventional UHF communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Transmit Ciphered Messages</td><td>To transmit ciphered messages, position the microphone button to UHF and wait until a momentary tone is heard before voice input. With the power knob set to ON, the momentary tone is delayed 0.5 seconds after pressing the microphone button. During this time, an encryption check is performed and the sync preamble is transmitted to receiving stations. If the encryption check fails, a 1200 Hz tone interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate is presented in the headsets and cipher transmission is not possible. If the encryption check succeeds, a momentary tone is heard in the headsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cipher Radio Communications</td><td>After the momentary tone is heard, establish two-way cipher radio communications with a cooperating station and check for readability and signal strength and/or transmit your message. Upon releasing the microphone button, the KY-28 will return to the standby condition. Simultaneous transmission by two or more stations on the same frequency is not possible and may result in garbled messages or loss of synchronization.</td></tr>

<p>Optimum use of the aircraft to obtain maximum performance with minimum fuel
consumption requires careful preflight planning for the mission. The planning of
a mission involves many things which are beyond the scope of this publication.
As used here, mission planning will cover certain key phases of a mission and
explain the use of performance charts.</p>
<p>The following sample Counter Air mission demonstrates features of performance
data. Although the sample problem does not cover the many mission capabilities
of the aircraft, it familiarizes the aircrew with the use of performance data so
that any mission may be preflight planned in a short time.</p>
<p>The sample problem illustrates, through a graphical solution, how performance
charts can be integrated to form a complete mission flight plan. The steps used
to develop such a plot are shown with the problem.</p>
<h2 id="counter-air-mission-profile"><a class="header" href="#counter-air-mission-profile">Counter Air Mission Profile</a></h2>
<p>Perform maximum thrust takeoff and climb at military thrust. Cruise at optimum
altitude and maximum range speed to a combat zone 500 miles from the air base.
Drop external tanks when empty. Perform combat maneuvering at maximum thrust for
the full duration — allowed by return and landing fuel requirements. Missiles
and gun rounds are assumed to be expended at the end of the combat period.
Return to the airfield at optimum altitude and airspeed. Descend at maximum
range descent, arriving at the destination with 2000 pounds landing fuel
reserve. The Counter Air Mission Overview and the Sample Mission Plan depict the
overall mission plan.</p>

<!-- would be cool to have some emergency "frame" (2-colored stripe around page) like in manual -->
<p>This section contains procedures to be followed to correct
an emergency condition. These procedures will insure
maximum safety for the crew and/or aircraft until a safe
landing or other appropriate action is accomplished. The
procedures are arranged in the most desirable sequence
for the majority of cases; therefore, the steps should be
performed in the listed sequence unless the pilot can
determine a good cause for deviation. Multiple
emergencies, adverse weather, and other peculiar
conditions may require modification of these procedures.
The critical items <strong>(BOLD FACE LETTERS)</strong> contained in the
various emergency procedures cover the most adverse
conditions. <strong>Aircrew members should be able to accomplish
bold face procedures without reference to the checklist.</strong>
The nature and severity of the encountered emergency
will dictate the necessity for complying with the critical
items in their entirety. It is essential, therefore, that
aircrews determine the correct course of action by use of
common sense and sound judgement. As soon as possible,
the pilot should notify the WSO, flight or flight leader, and
tower of any existing emergency and of the intended
action.</p>
<p>The terms "Land as soon as <strong>possible</strong>" and "Land as soon
as <strong>practical</strong>" are used in this section. These terms are
defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Land as soon as possible</strong> - An emergency will be declared.
A landing should be accomplished at the nearest suitable
airfield considering the severity of the emergency,
weather conditions, field facilities, ambient lighting,
aircraft gross weight, and command guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Land as soon as practical</strong> - Emergency conditions are less
urgent, and although the mission is to be terminated, the
degree of the emergency is such that an immediate
landing at the nearest adequate airfield may not be
necessary.</p>
<p>The following basic rules apply to all aircraft emergencies
and should be thoroughly understood by all aircrew:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain aircraft control.</li>
<li>Analyze the situation and take proper action.</li>
<li>Land as soon as practical.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="emergency_procedures/../intro/definitions.html">Definitions</a> for an explanation of the symbology used.</p>

<h2 id="glide-distance"><a class="header" href="#glide-distance">GLIDE DISTANCE</a></h2>
<p>With both engines failed, the aircraft will glide
approximately 6 nautical miles for each 5000 feet AGL.
The recommended glide airspeed for maximum range with
both engines out is 215 knots. This speed will allow the
windmilling engines to maintain power control hydraulic
pressures within safe limits but may not be optimum for
airstart.</p>
<h2 id="ejection"><a class="header" href="#ejection">EJECTION</a></h2>
<p>At ground level with wings level, canopy closed, and no

knots if neither crewmember’s boarding weight is over 247
pounds. Boarding weight includes the crewmember and all
personal equipment with which he boards the aircraft. If
either crewmember’s boarding weight is over 247 pounds,
the minimum ejection airspeed is 50 knots. Initiate
ejection below 450 knots if possible. Although the seat is
qualified to 600 knots, ejection above 450 knots exposes the
crewmember to forces which can cause serious injury. If
airspeed is over 550 knots, minimum ejection altitude is 50
feet. In controlled level flight, eject above 2000 feet AGL
if possible. If out-of-control at or below 10,000 feet AGL,
eject.</p>

<h2 id="emergency-landing-pattern"><a class="header" href="#emergency-landing-pattern">EMERGENCY LANDING PATTERN</a></h2>
<p>The emergency landing pattern is a pattern to be flown
when engine thrust is available and an emergency exists
or there is a malfunction which could result in an
emergency. The primary objective of the pattern is to land
the aircraft safely in the first attempt with least amount
of risk. Because of the many variables involved, such as
type of emergency, position and altitude in relation to the
field, gross weight, fuel remaining, weather, populated
areas, runway length, availability of arresting gear, etc.,
astandard pattern cannot be prescribed. Depending on the
circumstances it might be desirable to utilize GCA, make
a straight-in approach, enter the pattern from downwind
or base leg, or make a 360° overhead pattern. Because of
the various circumstances, the pilot’s evaluation of all
factors and his judgment will determine the type of
landing pattern to be flown. However, there are some
general guidelines which are applicable regardless of
approach selected: Reduce gross weight to minimum
practical. In the pattern and before establishing the
landing configuration, maintain a minimum maneuvering
airspeed of 230 knots (250 knots, single engine). The
pattern should be planned to avoid abrupt, steep or hard
turns and large or abrupt power changes especially with
a flight control malfunction or a hydraulic system failure.
Circumstances permitting, a long straight-in final should
be planned and the landing configuration established
when on final. The air refuel switch should be placed to
EXTEND prior to landing to depressurize the fuel tanks.
Should the nature of the emergency or other factors
dictate establishing the landing configuration prior to
final, 230 knots — flaps up, or 200 knots - slats flaps OUT
AND DOWN should be maintained until established on
final. These airspeeds will provide a margin of safety for
maneuvering flight. If the pattern must be entered on
downwind, base or from an overhead pattern, the pattern
should be expanded, the landing configuration established
prior to final, and roll-out on final should be at least 2-
3 miles out. A normal 2-3° glide slope should be flown. For
most emergencies, final approach airspeeds are increased
and AOA decreased to provide adequate aircraft handling
characteristics.</p>

<p>Of special note is a <a href="dcs/modding/overview.html">modding guide</a> and explanation available
to <a href="dcs/mission_editor.html">mission designers</a>.</p>

<p><img src="dcs/../img/controls_overview.jpg" alt="Controls Overview" /></p>
<p>Available control binds for the Phantom are exhaustive. For any switch, knob or
button, you can choose between direct position-binds, increment or decrement
binds, a toggle or next option, special binds for 2-way or 3-way switches and
assignable axis.</p>
<p>In total, both cockpits feature around 1000 assignable binds and 200 axis each.</p>
<p>As example, the <strong>Speed Brake</strong> switch provides 8 binds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed Brake - In</li>
<li>Speed Brake - Stop</li>
<li>Speed Brake - Out (Hold)</li>
<li>Speed Brake - [Aft]</li>
<li>Speed Brake - [Forward]</li>
<li>Speed Brake - [Next]</li>
<li>Speed Brake - In/Stop (3-way up)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Out</strong>-position is marked <strong>(Hold)</strong> to signal that the position is
spring-loaded and will return to center once released.</p>
<p>Binds <strong>[Aft]</strong> and <strong>[Forward]</strong> are directional binds that move the switch
from the current position into the given direction.</p>
<p><strong>[Next]</strong> is similar, but will not stop at the last position and wrap over to
the first position again. Likewise, 2-way switches provide a <strong>[Toggle]</strong> bind
that flips the switch between either position.</p>
<p>The <strong>(3-way up)</strong>-bind is intended to be used with actual 3-way hardware
switches, such as present on many external devices. They send a signal on either
position (up and down), but no signal on the center position. Hence, the bind
will return the switch back to the center when no signal is send.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The <strong>(3-way down)</strong>-bind is skipped for the Speed Brake, since it would be
identical with the spring-loaded <strong>Out (Hold)</strong>-bind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All binds are generally assigned at least two searchable categories, the
<strong>system</strong> the bind belongs to and its <strong>location</strong> in the cockpit. The <strong>Master
Arm</strong> switch for example has categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapons</li>
<li>Main Panel</li>
<li>Weapon Selection Panel</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sim-pit"><a class="header" href="#sim-pit">Sim-Pit</a></h2>
<p>Additionally to regular binds, special <strong>[SimPit]</strong>-binds are provided that
allow controlling any switch or knob via an axis input.</p>
<p>For example, a switch with 2 positions ON and OFF can be controlled with an
axis, while the switch changes its position as soon as the axis is pushed beyond
its center position.</p>
<p>This is especially useful for builders of cockpit replicas, working mainly with
hardware switches whose electronic components send normalized inputs through the
entire movement range.</p>
<h2 id="jester--crew-chief-commands"><a class="header" href="#jester--crew-chief-commands">Jester &amp; Crew Chief Commands</a></h2>
<p>Direct binds to control Jester and Crew Chief commands are provided especially
for mission designers or users of voice recognition software, such as
<strong>VoiceAttack</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/jester_commands_binds.jpg" alt="Jester Commands" /></p>
<p>This allows use of the corresponding actions directly via a bind instead of
using the UI to select them.</p>
<h2 id="binding-guide"><a class="header" href="#binding-guide">Binding Guide</a></h2>
<p>When just getting started, a common question is which fundamental controls one should
generally bind and have accessible without using the mouse, besides the obvious
binds of throttle and stick axis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Items marked <strong>bold</strong> are highly recommended to be bound. <em>Italic</em> sections
are suggestions of which positions to bind.</p>

<p>The bombing calculator provides the pilot and WSO with an easy way to calculate
the needed values for the different bombing modes. You can use it to calculate
every value (except for drag coefficient) that you need to drop precise
ordinance on your target. It is opened with the hotkey
<kbd>RCtrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> and can be closed with the same hotkey in-game.
You can also bind it to a desired button in the controls tab.</p>

<h2 id="example-run"><a class="header" href="#example-run">Example run</a></h2>
<p>This is a step-by-step guide for an example loft bombing run with 12 Mk-82s. In
our case we want the fourth bomb to hit the target. The first three should hit
in front of the target and the rest should impact behind the target. For that we
will use the release advance.</p>
<h3 id="planning-advance"><a class="header" href="#planning-advance">Planning: Advance</a></h3>
<p>The first step in planning our loft bombing run is to identify and pick a
target. In this example run we want to bombard the red units standing on the X.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/map_target_position.jpg" alt="map_target_position" /></p>
<h3 id="planning-ip"><a class="header" href="#planning-ip">Planning: IP</a></h3>
<p>In the second step we will take a look at the F10-Map and make out an Identification
Point (IP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The IP should always have a good visibility while flying the plane as
optical identification of the IP will be the main method of timing the press
of the bomb button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/map_ingress_point.jpg" alt="map_ingress_point" /></p>
<p>For our target we chose the lake just north of the target as an IP. Now we
measure the distance from our IP to the target and note it down as we need to
input that to the bombing calculator. In this case the distance is 4.03 NM which
we will cut off to 4 NM since the bombing calculator can only take 10ths of a
mile.</p>
<h3 id="planning-target"><a class="header" href="#planning-target">Planning: Target</a></h3>
<p>Now we also need to note the elevation of the target in MSL. To get that
information we just click on a unit and read the altitude out of the box in the
lower left corner. In this case the target elevation is 32 ft which we will cut
down to 30 ft since the bombing calculator can only take values of tens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If the target unit is not visible on the F10 map you can also hover over
the position of the enemy unit and read the elevation next to the coordinates
in the upper left corner of the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/map_target_elevation.jpg" alt="map_target_elevation" /></p>
<h3 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution">Solution</a></h3>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/f4_bombing_calc_example.jpg" alt="bombing_calculator_numbered" /></p>
<p>Now that we have all needed values from the map we will put those in the bombing
calculator.</p>
<p>(<num>1</num>) Here we can select the mode of delivery which is LOFT in our example.</p>
<p>(<num>2</num>) Here we select the type of our bomb. In our case Mk-82s.</p>
<p>(<num>3</num>) We want to do our run-in at 350 knots true Airspeed.</p>
<p>(<num>4</num>) For our run-in altitude we want it to be at 3000 ft above MSL.</p>
<p>(<num>5</num>) We measured the distance between our Ingress Point and target
earlier at the second step. Now we will put that in.</p>
<p>(<num>6</num>) We got our target altitude from the F10 map and can put it in
now.</p>
<p>(<num>7</num>) We want our Loft Angle to be at 30°, we put that in.</p>
<p>(<num>8</num>) The bombing calculator now gives us back the Pull-Up Timer that
the WSO can than put in at a later step. Alternatively it can be transferred via the "Tell Jester
and close" or the "Tell Jester" Button.</p>
<p>(<num>9</num>) The bombing calculator also gives us the Pullup Range. This is only as pilot
information.</p>
<p>(<num>10</num>) Further as a pilot information the bombing calculator gives us our release range.</p>
<p>(<num>11</num>) We want to drop our bombs with a release Interval of 0.15
seconds, so we put that in</p>
<p>(<num>12</num>) As we decided on the beginning we want the fourth bomb to be on
the target.</p>
<p>(<num>13</num>) In the release advance window the bombing calculator now gives
us the value that the WSO can put in later.</p>
<h3 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h3>
<p>Now the WSO can put in the Loft Angle at the release angle, the pull-up timer at
the bombing timers and the release advance in the release advance in the WRCS.</p>
<h3 id="execution"><a class="header" href="#execution">Execution</a></h3>
<p>Now you only need to fly the maneuver for the Loft delivery as precise as
possible to make sure you hit the target right. The more precise you fly, the
more precise your bombing run will be.</p>

<h2 id="spotting-circle"><a class="header" href="#spotting-circle">Spotting Circle</a></h2>
<p>To aid in crew coordination, during startup and planning, a commonly employed
technique is to select a static object at distance, such as a building, vehicle
or tree, and drawing a circle around it.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/spotting_circle_setup.jpg" alt="Spotting Circle Setup" /></p>
<p>The circle drawn by the Pilot and the WSO will now roughly point in the same
direction and, once in air, can be used to enhance coordination.</p>
<p>For example, if the Pilot spots a target, they can tell the WSO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is a target 100m right to the circle."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The WSO can now use his circle marker to locate the right spot.</p>

<p>The F-4 has several special options selectable in the Mission Editor.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/mission_editor_special_options.jpg" alt="Special Options" /></p>
<h2 id="condition-and-wear"><a class="header" href="#condition-and-wear">Condition and Wear</a></h2>
<p><em>"And I'll tell you what, since Cal's on it,
it's only flown on approved cross-countries and drill weekends.
Mint condition, folks, no over-Gs."</em></p>
<p>All components of the aircraft simulate wear individually, yielding a unique
experience on each spawn, but also based on how the F-4 is flown.</p>
<p>It is generally differentiated between <strong>Condition</strong> and the <strong>Wear and Tear</strong>,
both are dynamic at spawn and can be influenced throughout a mission by various
factors such as forces, temperature and also combat damage.</p>
<p>The aircraft has thousands of components that are subject to this system. One
concrete example would be the speed of the Pave Spike Targeting Pod elevation
gimbal motor. Under perfect condition, it is supposed to have a speed of 60
degrees per second. However, a factory generally can not ensure this to always
be the case and accepts a variance, for example it must be within 1% error.</p>
<p>Mathematically, variance is simulated as <strong>normal distribution</strong>, consisting of
the parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>μ (Mu, mean) - the value it would have under perfect condition</li>
<li>σ (Sigma) - the variance of the value</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/normal_distribution.jpg" alt="Normal Distribution" /></p>
<p>Around 70% of times the value will be within one unit of σ, in 95% of cases it
will be within 2 units of σ. Extreme cases above 3 units of σ are possible, but
very rare.</p>
<p>Said motor has for example a σ value of 3% around 60 degrees per second, meaning
that the vast majority of targeting pods will be produced with a motor capable
of moving the elevation gimbal between 58 and 62 degrees per second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Variance goes in both directions, your Phantom can also be faster than it
is supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="aircraft-condition"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-condition">Aircraft Condition</a></h3>
<p>An aircraft's condition generally refers to its factory and production quality.
For example, during war times a factory might run out of supplies and reduce
their acceptance criteria during production, generally increasing variance in
individual component performance.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Condition</strong>
slider, indicating quality from 0% (poor quality) to 100% (high quality).</p>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 0%, its speed variance σ
will increase from 3% to 8%, causing majority of pods to be produced with a
speed between 55 and 65 degrees per second instead.</p>
<p>Aircraft condition will always still be within limits that a manufacturer might
find reasonably acceptable. The aircraft is always still fully functional and
operational.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft-wear-and-tear"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-wear-and-tear">Aircraft Wear and Tear</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to production quality, components can degrade during service based
on time since the last overhaul, external factors like temperature and weather,
aggressive flying involving a lot of forces on the airframe, as well as combat
damage.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Wear and Tear</strong>
slider, indicating wear from 0% (no wear) to 100% (a lot of wear), or even
beyond that. For an aircraft that was just repaired and came fresh out of
service, 0% is appropriate. 100% refers to the latest point at which an aircraft
would reasonably be send back for maintenance, as it starts being less effective
in practice. Values beyond, such as 500%, can be used to represent scenarios in
which pilots are forced to fly an aircraft that operates exceptionally below its
expected performance level. It is still somewhat usable, nothing is straight out
broken, but components just do not behave within acceptable parameters anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Values beyond 100% cannot be set in the Mission Editor,
but are achievable in-flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 100% wear, its speed
variance σ will additionally increase by 20%. Assuming a good initial starting
condition, the motor will at that point likely operate between 45 and 75 degrees
per second.</p>

<h3 id="reference-aircraft"><a class="header" href="#reference-aircraft">Reference Aircraft</a></h3>
<p>The variance system at initial spawn can be turned off with this checkbox, if
desired. Components will then start with their mean value μ, without any
variance.</p>
<p>That is, with the option checked the setting for condition, as well as wear and
tear are ignored and disabled. The aircraft will spawn with all properties set
exactly as specified by the manufacturer and according to documentation, without
any variance.</p>
<p>This is especially interesting for competitions, where both sides should start
with the same conditions for fairness. Or when performing tests and computing
performance charts, where the aircraft should always start with the exact same
values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Even the reference aircraft is still subject to wear and tear during
flight. In a competition, if you pull high Gs, your aircraft's component
properties will deviate from your opponents.</p>

<h2 id="ins-reference-alignment-stored"><a class="header" href="#ins-reference-alignment-stored">INS Reference Alignment Stored</a></h2>
<p>This checkbox allows significant reduction of the time needed for a proper INS
alignment during cold-start.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ground crew would previously have started the aircraft and
executed a full alignment, then shut it down again, while memorizing parts of
the alignment data.</p>

<p>It is possible to set up a station in the Mission Editor for use in ADF
navigation. To do this, a unit, such as a ground station, needs to be placed on
the map. This unit should then execute a command to tune into the desired AM
frequency (<em>Perform Command &gt; Set Frequency</em>). Finally, the unit must transmit a
message continuously throughout the mission, which requires setting the message
to loop (<em>Perform Command &gt; Transmit Message</em>).</p>

<h2 id="lessons"><a class="header" href="#lessons">Lessons</a></h2>
<p>These missions, we like to call them "lessons", have been designed in such a way that, as a
beginner, everything important that you need for a successful start with your new F-4E Phantom II is
explained.</p>
<h2 id="goals"><a class="header" href="#goals">Goals</a></h2>
<p>The stated goal of these lessons is that after completing them once or several times, you can
say: "Hey, I think I now know how this thing works (again)".
You can use the lessons as "initial training" or as so-called "recurrent training". Whenever
you haven't flown for a long time and need a refresher. By the way: We recommend a refresher
every 90 days at least ...</p>
<p>Please note that the lessons require a certain level of knowledge and basic flying skills. In the
lessons we don't explain flying as such, but rather the aircraft, its systems and their usage, and
the behavior. The lessons may therefore be understood as a kind of "interactive type training in the
cockpit seat" and not as "basic flying training".</p>
<h2 id="your-way-through"><a class="header" href="#your-way-through">Your way through</a></h2>
<p>Due to the design, systems and age of the jet, it has many pecularities. Precise application of
system knowledge in daily duty on this wonderful aircraft is the key to success. With the F-4E
Phantom II you will be challenged in so many ways. So be ready! We leave it up to you whether you
want to get in the air immediately without studying the manual, or whether you want to read upon it
before your first flight ...</p>
<p>Decide for yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to fly immediately, the training lessons will provide you with enough knowledge to
successfully complete these flights. You can even study this section or other parts of the manual
during your flights; this is another innovation in the DCS F-4E Phantom II. The lessons can be
paused at any time if necessary. Of course, you are welcome to practice multi-tasking and fly at the
same time as studying the manual; that's not explicitly forbidden! Learning by doing is the basic
strategy for the training lessons, but you will be required to read through the manual and carefully
study the systems if you want to become a real pro.</p>
<h2 id="procedures"><a class="header" href="#procedures">Procedures</a></h2>
<p>We have depicted the most important "normal procedures" of the aircraft and have based the lessons
very much on reality. These procedures should also be based as closely as possible on the real
procedures, although we were aware that it wouldn't be possible to implement everything in the
simulation. Think, for example, of the ejection seat harness, the oxygen mask and its test, the
transponder, the IFF system, or similar systems. Some steps are left out because they are already
set correctly after spawning the aircraft and to really speed up the lesson to get you in the air;
of course you may check them as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, not all procedures are depicted as can be found in real aircraft manuals; some of
them had to be changed, shortened, or omitted entirely. Nevertheless, for example, we
simulated putting on the helmet (including sun protection visor and sun glasses), an immersive
innovation in DCS.</p>
<h2 id="our-way"><a class="header" href="#our-way">Our way</a></h2>
<p>We thought a lot about how best to explain the operation of such a complex aircraft with training
missions. Where do you start, where do you end? How detailed should it be so that a "nerd" doesn't
miss anything, how superficial can it be so that a "leisure gamer" doesn't lose interest? How tight
are the checks whether the player is adhering to the procedures and the planned flight route? A
basic idea at Heatblur has always been to get players "in the air" as quickly as possible, without
them having to spend hours watching introductory videos or studying thick books. All of this caused
us a lot of headaches...</p>
<p>In any case, we spared no expense, effort and discussions to serve both types of players more or
less "equally". As you can imagine, such a project is not entirely trivial, and you have to make a
lot of compromises when designing the lessons. Sometimes, you have to tell hardliners: "Hey, this
might be too difficult for the players and not really relevant to the simulation, eventhough it
would be extra cool!" You have to convince other team members to do things they personally don't
like: Hey, that's exactly what the players need, but a little different please!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had professional help from SME's (real former Phantom pilots and weapons systems
officer and even instructors). These guys helped us with so many decisions, and spiced the product
with their knowledge and experience. Conversely, they slapped us on the wrist if we left out
something they thought was important.</p>
<p>In a complex development process that such a high-quality DCS module requires, there are many
obstacles and limitations, but also many opportunities and possibilities. That's why we made it a
point right from the start to present the handling of the aircraft's systems as comprehensively as
possible.</p>
<p>We hope you like what you have in hands now!</p>
<h2 id="lessons-overview"><a class="header" href="#lessons-overview">Lessons Overview</a></h2>
<p>This section is limited to the description of the first 4 lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lesson 01 - Startup</li>
<li>Lesson 02 - Taxi</li>
<li>Lesson 03 - Normal Takeoff</li>
<li>Lesson 04 - Visual approach</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-tips-and-tricks"><a class="header" href="#general-tips-and-tricks">General Tips and Tricks</a></h2>
<p>It rarely happens that you get stuck in a procedure, or you don't know exactly what to do
next.</p>
<p>Here are some general tips &amp; tricks as created by testers during the testing phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>For lessons starting on the ground, the noise might be very loud. You have three options:
<ul>
<li>Wait until the other jets have taken off before beginning with the lesson.</li>
<li>You are allowed to close the canopy whenever you need to (default binding is LCTRL+C), despite
the F-4 usually closes it very lately</li>
<li>Adjust the audio volume of DCS to suit the autio hardware you are using.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have troubles with a very dark cockpit, a few things can be done:
<ul>
<li>Use the internal cockpit illumination on the COCKPIT LIGHTS panel (right side):
<ul>
<li>The CONSOLE OFF/BRT knob</li>
<li>The INSTR PANEL knob</li>
<li>The CONSOLE FLOOD light switch</li>
<li>The INST FLOOD light switch</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/training_mission_cockpit_lights.jpg" alt="training_tips_illumination_pic" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Cockpit Global Illumination" to ON</li>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Gamma" to 2.0 or higher values.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emergencies"><a class="header" href="#emergencies">Emergencies</a></h2>
<p>There are situations in which the triggers of a lesson no longer work properly for some unknown
reason. Fortunately, this only happens very rarely! This usually results in the highlights (the
yellow helper boxes) no longer being shown or hidden correctly, or the logic circuits no longer
reacting correctly to events in the simulation. We experienced this ourselves during the testing
phase and would like to at least inform you about it here and now.</p>
<p>The influence of the time acceleration function on the stability of the lessons is not documented,
but to be on the safe side we advise against using the time acceleration function.</p>
<p>If you got stuck in a lesson, you should take the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay calm! The two most important pilot rules apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aviate, navigate, communicate.</li>
<li>Don't crash, and above all: don't break anything!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check whether everything in the aircraft is actually set up as required according to the
checklist/procedure. If necessary, go up the list a few steps and again check each step
individually, starting from the top by asking yourself: What is written in the book? &gt;
How did I set it up?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn't help:
Jump back one, or even more steps (how to do this is explained above)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn't help either:
Jump back to the beginning of the procedure (how to do this is explained above)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all that doesn't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quit the mission and save the DEBRIEFING (log-file) and the TRACK (trk-file) in the
debriefing screen</li>
<li>If you suspect a bug, please open a new ticker in the DCS forum &gt; Heatblur Simulations &gt;
Phantom area using this link: <a href="https://forum.dcs.world/forum/919-dcs-f-4-phantom/">https://forum.dcs.world/forum/919-dcs-f-4-phantom/</a>. Please
add as much information as possible in order to help us finding a possible issue. Thank
you for your support!</li>
<li>In any case, we recommend to restart DCS and load the mission again. Sorry for that!</li>

<h3 id="lesson-01---kobuleti-airfield"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01---kobuleti-airfield">Lesson 01 - Kobuleti airfield</a></h3>
<p>The airfield has a picturesque location between the mountains to the south and the Black Sea
to the west. Here is a photo of the airfield, taken a month ago from a helicopter, looking S-
W.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Kobuleti_Airfield.jpg" alt="kobuleti_airfield" /></p>
<p>The entire F-4E Phantom II training for your year (July 1995 syllabus) will be held in Kobuleti.
The choice fell on an airfield in the Caucasus region for understandable reasons, as this map is
delivered with DCS as standard. The designated training areas in the south of Georgia (designated
as "Training Area W" and "Training Area E") offer a sufficiently large playground for training,
including supersonic flights.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Georgia_Training_Area.jpg" alt="training_area" /></p>
<h3 id="lesson-01---weather"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01---weather">Lesson 01 - Weather</a></h3>
<p>The weather has been very bad in the last few days. A persistent Black Sea depression had brought a
lot of rain. However, stabilization occurred last night and morning. Dry air mass flows in from the
east. The mid-level cloud layer is expected to break up. The weather forecast predicts that the
clouds will no longer be a problem in about an hour and the temperature will rise quickly due to
strong sunshine. However, ground-level haze is still to be expected as the ground has stored a lot
of moisture and heavy evaporation from the sun is to be expected.</p>

<p>Your fellow pilots will begin their flights immediately, your flight a little later. The airfield is
a very noisy environment, so wait until the jets currently positioned on the runway have taken off
before beginning with the lesson. Then the noise level should be somewhat tolerable... hopefully at
least.</p>

<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 02:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 7:
The flight controls check can be omitted in case it becomes too difficult. Use the FIRE
TEST BUTTON on the instrument panel before or during performing this check to skip it. The
reason for this is that for this check a few things have to be done in parallel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to our instructor</li>
<li>Performing the inputs on the flight control system (movements and button/switch
presses/settings)</li>
<li>Listening to the confirmation given by the crew chief</li>
<li>Pressing "Spacebar" after receiving the crew chief's confirmation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 7f &amp; 7h: The crew chief will not respond when you set the rudder to the neutral
position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Introduction:
Observe that the audio containing the taxi clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signal to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Step 1a)
Use the power levers very gently! Once the aircraft started rolling, pull back the power
levers to idle and carefully control the taxi speed using minimum power together with
the wheel brakes.</p>

<p>The lessons are divided into tasks, which are based on the names of the procedures. These tasks
are divided into individual steps, whereby the steps go hand in hand with the individual items in
the procedure. The tasks for this lesson are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Check aircraft while being positioned at the holding point for RWY 07.</li>
<li>Task 2: Line-up the aircraft on RWY 07</li>
<li>Task 3: Check essential aircraft systems while being lined up on RWY 07</li>
<li>Task 4: Perform a normal take-off (slats &amp; flaps "out" &amp; "down") on RWY 07</li>
<li>Task 5: Perform a normal climb at 350kts or M0.9 (whichever is reached first), by following
turnpoints 1, 2 and 3.</li>
<li>Task 6: Perform cruise checks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lesson-03---tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#lesson-03---tips--tricks">Lesson 03 - Tips &amp; tricks</a></h3>
<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 03:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Steps 4a - 4e:
The flight controls check only requires to check if the stick is moving freely (at least 50%
of the stick deflection must be made). You can also check the rudder, but this is not
required by that step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 10:
Having the MASTER CAUTION alert active indicates something is or at least was wrong. So
reset it, then check if it stays out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Step 1:
Observe that the audio containing the line-up clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signals to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Introduction
Observe that the audio containing the take-off clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signals to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 5:
For beginners, we recommend to perform the first take-off without afterburner (just MIL
power, which means 100% rpm without afterburner), despite we know that taking off with
afterburner is a ton of fun. The reason behind is, that you will then be able to hear all
call-outs of your instructor, because the time needed for the take-off is long enough.
Whenever you think you manage all steps by heart that are necessary for a safe take-off
without any instructions, go for a take-off with afterburner. Please don't tell our SME's
that this text exists at all, and never tell someone that you have followed the
recommendation ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take-off:
Before taking off, go through the takeoff procedure. You need to remember the items by heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>No NGS after 70 knots</li>
<li>Full aft STICK by 80 knots</li>
<li>Hold 10 to 12° NOSE UP</li>
<li>Raise the GEAR &amp; FLAPS as soon as airborne</li>
<li>TRIM as needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 8:
In DCS, with the current wind situation (no cross wind component), it is really not
necessary to use the nose gear steering. You will only be reminded by the instructor in case
you use the nose gear steering above 70 knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 11:
Pitch trim is best done in a number of quick pulses instead of one long press to avoid over-
trimming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Steps 13:
Make sure to have flaps retracted before reaching 250 knots, but there is a certain safety
buffer and they should not be damaged at exactly 250 knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 5 &gt; Step 1:
Make sure to fly a heading of about 064° and climb after lift-off.
Make sure to fly at an airspeed of not more than 350 knots.
Fly a shallow climb when using no afterburner (about 10° pitch angle).
Fly a steep climb when using afterburner (about 30° pitch angle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reaching a certain altitude and airspeed with gear and flaps up, the lesson is
accomplished. You may continue the climb following the route which is commanded by your
instructor. If you got "lost in space", open up the F-10 map, click on your aircraft, and
observe the planned flightroute; you may then follow it more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 6 &gt; Step 1d:
There is currently no way of comparing the values on both altimeters. This step was kept in
the procedure just in case you need it when operating with a real WSO in the rear seat.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="lesson-04---tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#lesson-04---tips--tricks">Lesson 04 - Tips &amp; tricks</a></h3>
<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 04:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the jet:
Pitch trim is best done in a number of quick pulses instead of one long press to avoid
over-trimming.</li>
<li>Autopilot:
Use the autopilot modes "attitude hold" and "altitude hold" whenever you think you need your hands
free. The system is a great assistant, so use it!</li>
<li>DME distances:
DME distance information is shown on the lower left corner of the HSI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson04_HSI_DME.jpg" alt="lesson04_dme_distance" /></p>
<ul>
<li>HSI course settings:
The course setting can be changed with the COURSE SET KNOB on the lower right corner of the HSI:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson04_HSI_HDG.jpg" alt="lesson04_hsi_course" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1 &gt; Step 4:
If you can't reach the COMM Antenna Select Switch, move the throttles back for a moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson04_COMM_Antenna_switch.jpg" alt="lesson04_comm_antenna" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1 &gt; Step 8:
The transition altitude in this particular region is 4,000m (13,120 ft), and the transition level
is
flight level 140 (FL140, which is 14,000 feet). When you descend through 14,000 feet, you have to
set your altimeter to the value of the local QNH (which today is 29.84 in/HG). It's no big deal if
you forget about that, it is not relevant for the outcome of the lesson.</li>
<li>PENETRATION / DESCENT:
Follow the instructions as good as possible. You may engage the attitude hold autopilot during
descent and focus on airspeed and power management. Don't forget to set the QNH once passing the
transition level (in this case 14,000 feet).</li>
<li>PENETRATION / TURN:
Fly a shallow left turn. If you have already reached 2,500 feet altitude, good. If you are still
higher, continue descending during the left turn until reaching 2500 feet. Keep an eye on your
sink
rate. Fly smoothly, and don't work hard on the stick. Intercept radial 064 as good as you can in
order to align on the runway heading. Treat her like a lady, and think ahead! Use the F-10 map if
you got lost in space. Don't rush into Batumi airspace.
Landing permission is already given. You are the last flight approaching the airfield for the next
two hours.</li>
<li>Task 2:
Remember these five items by heart: GEAR / FLAPS / HYDRAULIC PRESSURE / WARNING LIGHTS / ANTI SKID</li>
<li>Task 3:
If you fly correct airspeeds, all instructions can be heard until the end. If you rush, the
timeline
becomes compressed and the sequence of events then may become overwhelming.
During the approach continuously cross check Pitch / Power / Trim. Look out for the runway, adjust
your heading with slight roll maneuvers if necessary. Rise the seat in case you have troubles
seeing
the runway at higher angles of attack. Fly gently, follow the instructions, and think ahead!</li>
<li>Go-around:
In case you have the slightest doubt that you cannot manage a safe landing: GO AROUND. Fly the
missed approach procedure by entering a short left hand traffic pattern at 1500 feet at 250 knots.
Take your time, be patient with yourself, don't rush and keep an eye on airspeed and altitude!</li>
<li>Landing / flare:
The aircraft was certified for carrier landings. If you don't flare before touchdown at a 2°
to 3° approach path, you WILL slam the aircraft into the runway. This causes wear to the wheels
and the landing gear legs, but nothing more. You may decide on your own if you want to flare just
a bit to decrease the sink rate slightly. Sink rates above 3 to 4 m/s (600 to 700 ft/min)
depending on weight, might damage the landing gear though.</li>
<li>Landing / touchdown:
Make sure to stay aligned with the centerline using rudder only. Prepare yourself to deploy the
drag chute, which stabilizes the aircraft during the landing roll. Taxi to the end of the runway
and then leave it to the right side!</li>
<li>Taxi:
Follow the marshaller after leaving the runway. If you struggle performing the "After landing
procedure " while taxiing, you may stop the aircraft on the taxi way for that. The car though
will not stop. When finished with the procedure, continue taxiing to your initial parking
position, nose pointed towards shelter "25", and stop there.</li>

<p>Jesters entire library of phrases can be found in the Mod-Folder, for example:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Sounds\Jester</code></p>
<p>When editing sounds, it is necessary to restart DCS. Just reloading the mission
is not enough for changes to take effect.</p>
<h2 id="sdef"><a class="header" href="#sdef">sdef</a></h2>
<p>For DCS to understand the files, sound-definition-files (sdef) are located in:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Sounds\sdef\Jester</code></p>
<p>A sdef-file is a plain text-file that can be edited with any text-editor. Next to locating the
actual sound file, it can define properties such as gain or fade-in/-out effects,
as well as positioning the sound effect within the world when played.</p>

<p>That way, variations can be created, to prevent always playing the exact same sound.</p>
<h2 id="mood"><a class="header" href="#mood">Mood</a></h2>
<p>Jester sounds can be suffixed with <code>HI</code> to indicate variants that should only be played

<p>Useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lua Doc: <a href="https://www.lua.org/docs.html">https://www.lua.org/docs.html</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tables"><a class="header" href="#tables">Tables</a></h3>
<p>Lua in itself is a fairly simple language with not too many features. It
primarily revolves around the use of tables. Tables can be compared to arrays,
lists and dictionaries, or maps.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- dictionary
local person = {
  name = "John",
  age = 20,
}

-- array/list
local fruits = { "Orange", "Apple", "Lemon" }
</code></pre>
<p>Arrays also implicitly decay to dictionaries with ascending keys <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Access can be either in a lookup-style <code>person["age"] = 21</code>, or like fields
<code>person.age = 21</code>.</p>
<p>In Lua, indices start <strong>counting at 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">print(fruits[1]) -- Orange
</code></pre>
<p>The length of a table can be accessed using <code>#</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- appending to a table
fruits[#fruits + 1] = "Cherry"
</code></pre>
<p>Anything not explicitly set is given the value <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-example"><a class="header" href="#syntax-example">Syntax example</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function ageCheck(name, age)
  if age &lt; 18 then
    print("Sorry", name)
  else
    print("Okay", name)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h3 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h3>
<p>Lua itself does not provide classes. However, we created a framework to add
class-like structures to Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local Class = require('base.Class')

local Person = Class()
Person.name = nil -- fields
Person.age = nil

function Person:Constructor(name, age)
  self.name = name
  self.age = age
end

Person:Seal() -- Prevent adding/removing more values/functions to it
</code></pre>
<p>The framework also supports inheritance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')

local AssistAAR = Class(Behavior) -- inherits from Behavior
</code></pre>
<h2 id="debugging"><a class="header" href="#debugging">Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have any Lua debugger setup. One has to rely on caveman
debugging with prints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">print("hello world")
print("Person:", person)
print("Check:", foo, bar, baz)
</code></pre>
<p>Which can then be seen in console. Note that it might be necessary to
periodically call <code>io.flush()</code> to actually see the prints.</p>
<p>We also provide a Lua playground in <code>WizardJester.lua</code>, which is always executed
directly on startup.</p>
<p>It is also possible to edit Lua files while DCS runs, without restarting the
game. Simply edit a LUA file and then reload the DCS mission with
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> and the new Lua file will be effective.</p>
<h2 id="jester-api"><a class="header" href="#jester-api">Jester API</a></h2>
<p>Jesters logic is divided into 6 layers of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intention (<em>WIP</em>)</li>
<li>Plan (<em>WIP</em>)</li>
<li>Situation</li>
<li>Behavior</li>
<li>Task</li>
<li>Action</li>
</ul>
<p>Code is placed in the Mod-Folder, for example:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Jester</code></p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>As an example that touches most of the layers, we want to create a feature that
lets Jester report the current speed every couple of seconds during flight.</p>
<p>Therefore, we start with a Situation. A situation needs an activation and
deactivation <strong>Condition:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Airborne.lua
local Class = require 'base.Class'
local Condition = require 'base.Condition'

local Airborne = {}
Airborne.True = Class(Condition)
Airborne.False = Class(Condition)

function IsAirborne()
  -- details on observations later
  return GetJester().awareness:GetObservation("airborne") or false
end

function Airborne.True:Check()
  return IsAirborne() -- activation condition
end

function Airborne.False:Check()
  return not IsAirborne() -- deactivation condition
end

Airborne.True:Seal()
Airborne.False:Seal()
return Airborne
</code></pre>
<p>Activation and deactivation conditions do not necessarily have to be the same.</p>
<p>Now, we can use this condition in our <code>Flight</code> situation and add our desired
behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Flight.lua
local Class = require 'base.Class'
local Situation = require 'base.Situation'
local Airborne = require 'conditions.Airborne'
local ReportSpeed = require 'behaviors.ReportSpeed'
-- behavior will be defined in the next step

local Flight = Class(Situation)

-- it simply expects a class with a :Check() method
Flight:AddActivationConditions(Airborne.True:new())
Flight:AddDeactivationConditions(Airborne.False:new())

function Flight:OnActivation()
  self:AddBehavior(ReportSpeed) -- start our behavior
end

function Flight:OnDeactivation()
  self:RemoveBehavior(ReportSpeed) -- stop our behavior
end

Flight:Seal()
return Flight
</code></pre>
<p>The situation also has to be registered in <code>F-4E_WSO.lua</code> (<em>WIP</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- in F-4E_WSO.lua
...
function CreateF4E_WSOJester()
  ...
  wso::AddSituations(Flight:new())
  ...
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can define our behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ReportSpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')
local SaySpeed = require('tasks.common.SaySpeed')
-- Task will be defined in the next step

local ReportSpeed = Class(Behavior)

function ReportSpeed:Constructor()
  Behavior.Constructor(self)
end

function ReportSpeed:Tick()
  -- this is called periodically
  local task = SaySpeed:new(...) -- access to speed explained later
  GetJester():AddTask(task)
end

ReportSpeed:Seal()
return ReportSpeed
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this would let Jester say something on every tick, a bit too verbose. To
improve on this, the Urge-system has been created. We can wrap our task in an
<code>Urge</code> and it will only be called on a set interval (which is automatically
applied some variance based on Jesters fixation and stress level):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ReportSpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')
local Urge = require('base.Urge') -- added
local StressReaction = require('base.StressReaction') -- added
local SaySpeed = require('tasks.common.SaySpeed')

local ReportSpeed = Class(Behavior)

function ReportSpeed:Constructor()
  Behavior.Constructor(self)

  -- logic of the behavior
  local say_speed = function ()
    -- very simple in this case,
    -- but could also trigger multiple tasks based on conditions, if desired
    local task = SaySpeed:new(...)
    GetJester():AddTask(task)
    return {task}
  end

  -- define the urge
  self.urge = Urge:new({
    time_to_release = s(10), -- baseline interval (10s now)
    on_release_function = say_speed, -- what to execute
    stress_reaction = StressReaction.ignorance, -- how important is this to Jester
  })
  self.urge:Restart() -- start it
end

function ReportSpeed:Tick()
  -- we could also modify the urge now, if desired
  -- for example increasing the stress level
  self.urge:Tick() -- tick it
end

ReportSpeed:Seal()
return ReportSpeed
</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to create the actual Task that will take care of reporting the
given speed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- SaySpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Task = require('base.Task')
local SayAction = require('actions.SayAction')

local SaySpeed = Class(Task)

function SaySpeed:Constructor(speed)
  Task.Constructor(self)

  local on_activation = function()
    if speed &lt; kt(500) then
      -- see PhrasesList.txt for all supported voice lines
      self:AddAction(SayAction('awareness/wereslow'))
    else
      self:AddAction(SayAction('awareness/werefast'))
    end
  end

  self:AddOnActivationCallback(on_activation)
end

SaySpeed:Seal()
return SaySpeed
</code></pre>
<p>The last part is the final <code>Action</code>, in our case <code>SayAction</code>. Actions are
usually very generic and basic. In most cases, the existing <code>SayAction</code> will be
all thats needed. Refer to <code>SayAction.lua</code> for how it works.</p>
<p>If a behavior has no extra need for a specific task and just wants to say a
phrase, one can also directly use <code>SayTask</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- in a Behaviors logic
...
local task = SayTask:new('misc/outoffuel')
GetJester():AddTask(task)
...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="lreal-and-units"><a class="header" href="#lreal-and-units">LReal and units</a></h3>
<p>A very common need is to work with real values and units, such as speed or time.
Therefore, we have <code>LReal</code>s, with units defined in <code>LUnit</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local time = min(15)
local speed = kt(500)
local fuel = lb(12000)

if time &gt; s(10) then
  print("foo")
end

time = time - s(40)
</code></pre>
<p>Careful when doing scalar operations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- correct
time *= 2

-- incorrect
time *= s(2)
</code></pre>
<p>Latter would result in an invalid <code>LReal</code>, which can be checked for using
<code>time:IsValid()</code>.</p>
<p>If necessary, values can be converted to another unit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local timeInSeconds = time:ConvertTo(s)
print("Time:", timeInSeconds)
</code></pre>
<p><code>time.value</code> would access the raw underlying number.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-properties"><a class="header" href="#accessing-properties">Accessing properties</a></h3>
<p>Lua has full access to all <code>Property</code>s defined in our components and can access
them easily with <code>GetProperty</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function GetTotalFuelQuantity()
  local gauge_readout = GetProperty(
    "/Pilot Fuel Quantity Indicator/Fuel Meter", -- path
    "Internal Fuel Quantity Indication" -- property name
  ).value

  return gauge_readout or lb(10000)
end
</code></pre>
<p><code>GetProperty</code> expects the full path to the component within the component-tree
(that are all names of parent components), they must start with <code>/</code> to
indicate an absolute path.</p>
<p>The returned value is a wrapper <code>Property</code> object. Access to the underlying
value (in this case a <code>LReal</code> with unit <code>Pounds</code>) is given by
<code>GetProperty(...).value</code>.</p>
<h3 id="observations-and-senses"><a class="header" href="#observations-and-senses">Observations and Senses</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to direct property access, Jester has an Observation-System. The
system allows to make frequently used data accessible in an easy way, or also to
provide more complex data, i.e. coming from the DCS SDK.</p>
<p>Observations are part of <code>Sense</code>s, of which Jester has several (eyes, ears, …).
As of now, most of them are <em>WIP</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local isAirborne = GetJester().awareness:GetObservation("airborne") or false
</code></pre>
<h2 id="interactions"><a class="header" href="#interactions">Interactions</a></h2>
<p>One key aspect of Jester is that he can interact with the cockpit by clicking
switches, buttons and turning knobs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the API offers two approaches.</p>
<h3 id="component-interactions"><a class="header" href="#component-interactions">Component Interactions</a></h3>
<p>The preferred way to interact with the cockpit is via the component system.</p>
<p>To allow interaction, a manipulator has to be registered at <code>F_4E_WSO_Cockpit.lua</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ChaffMode: OFF, SGL, MULT, PROG
self:AddManipulator(
  "Chaff Mode",
  {component_path = "/WSO Cockpit/WSO Left Console/AN_ALE-40 CCU/Chaff Mode Knob"}
)
</code></pre>
<p>After that, it can easily be interacted with, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">task:AddAction(SwitchAction:new("Chaff Mode", "MULT"))
-- or in short
task:Click("Chaff Mode", "MULT")
</code></pre>
<p>or reading its current value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local cockpit = GetJester():GetCockpit()
local chaff_mode = cockpit:GetManipulator("Chaff Mode"):GetState()
</code></pre>
<h3 id="raw-interactions"><a class="header" href="#raw-interactions">Raw Interactions</a></h3>
<p>If the desired switch does not support the component interface yet,
one can instead fall back on a raw interface that invokes DCS commands directly,
as if the player would have triggered a bind manually.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- sends value 1 via command WSO_EJECT_INSTANT to device EJECTION_SEAT_SYSTEM
ClickRaw(devices.EJECTION_SEAT_SYSTEM, device_commands.WSO_EJECT_INSTANT, 1)

-- sends the value corresponding to position 2 on a 7-position knob
ClickRawKnob(devices.HUD_AN_ASG_26, device_commands.HUD_SelectHUDMode, 2, 7)
</code></pre>
<p>See <code>devices.lua</code> for all available devices and likewise <code>command_defs.lua</code> for
the commands.</p>
<p>In general, Knobs and 2-pos switches use the range <code>[0, 1]</code> for values, while
3-pos switches often (but not always) use <code>[-1, +1]</code>. For 3-pos switches <code>-1</code> is
usually used to move a 3-pos switch down, <code>+1</code> to move it up - but some switches
have a different orientation. See <code>default.lua</code> and <code>clickabledata.lua</code> to learn
more about a specific switch and how it reacts to values.</p>
<h2 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h2>
<p>Next to clicking switches, Jester can react to events send either from C++ or
also from within Lua. The system follows a simple observer/listener pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">ListenTo("go_silent", function(task)
  task:Click("Radar Power", "STBY")
end)
</code></pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">if is_aar then
  DispatchEvent("go_silent")
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="task-api"><a class="header" href="#task-api">Task API</a></h2>
<p>A core aspect of writing logic for Jester revolves around using the <code>Task</code> class.
Tasks consist of a sequence of <code>Action</code>s. A task can be paused, resumed or cancelled entirely by
the system if necessary.</p>
<p>Actions are, by design, executed asynchronously. Executing a click will take some time and
not execute instantly. In particular, adding a click action to a task will not block the code,
it simply gets added to the chain of actions to execute eventually.</p>
<p>This concept is similar to Future-APIs in other languages and <code>Task</code> offers a fluent-API to deal
with it conveniently.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local task = Task:new()
task:Roger()
  :Click("Radar Power", "OPER")
  :Wait(min(4))
  :Click("Screen Mode", "radar")
  :Say("phrases/radar_ready")
  :Then(function()
    self.scan_for_bandits = true
  end)
</code></pre>
<p>Among other functions, the API offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AddAction</code> - any <code>Action</code>, basis for the API</li>
<li><code>Then</code> - anonymous function</li>
<li><code>Wait</code> - time</li>
<li><code>WaitUntil</code> - predicate</li>
<li><code>Say</code> - phrase</li>
<li><code>Roger</code></li>
<li><code>CantDo</code></li>
<li><code>Click</code> - name, state</li>
<li><code>ClickFast</code> - name, state</li>
<li><code>ClickShort</code> - name, state</li>
<li><code>ClickShortFast</code> - name, state</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <code>Task.lua</code> for details.</p>
<h2 id="ui"><a class="header" href="#ui">UI</a></h2>
<p>Jester provides two types of user interfaces. A wheel with selectable options
and a dialog with questions and selectable answers that are shown on demand. See
<a href="dcs/modding/jester/wheel_ui.html">Wheel UI</a> and <a href="dcs/modding/jester/dialog_ui.html">Dialog UI</a> for more.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wheel-ui"><a class="header" href="#wheel-ui">Wheel UI</a></h1>
<p>Jester Wheel consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua
for modifying its content and reacting to actions.</p>
<h2 id="frontend"><a class="header" href="#frontend">Frontend</a></h2>
<p>The frontend is a <a href="https://pixijs.com/">Pixi JS</a> based website defined in</p>
<p><code>f-4e\ModFolders\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\UI\JesterWheel</code></p>
<p>Opening <code>index.html</code> in a browser shows the wheel filled with the base content.</p>
<p>The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS
(<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>).</p>
<p>The UI logic, such as animations are defined in <code>renderer.js</code>, while the
interactions are handled in <code>main.js</code>.</p>
<p><code>interface.js</code> declares the base content of the wheel, as well as all methods
relevant for the C++ to JS communication.</p>
<p>The method <code>hb_send_proxy</code> is used to send commands to C++, such as notifying it
that an action has been clicked.</p>
<h2 id="lua"><a class="header" href="#lua">Lua</a></h2>
<p>The wheel is essentially a menu-tree. Each menu consists of up to 8 items. An
item might be final or contain another sub-menu. Additionally, a sub-menu can
also be spawned as outer-menu, which increases its item slots to 18.</p>
<p>Each item can be associated with an <code>action</code>, a string that is tied to the Event
System and can hence be reacted to if invoked.</p>
<p>To interact with the menu, several methods are defined and exported to Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Wheel.ReplaceMainMenu(main_menu)
Wheel.ReplaceSubMenu(sub_menu, menu_location)
Wheel.AddItem(item, menu_location)
Wheel.RemoveItem(item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.ReplaceItem(item, item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.RenameItem(new_item_name, current_item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.SetMenuInfo(info_text, menu_location)
Wheel.NavigateTo(menu_location)
</code></pre>
<p>The following shows a simple example to add a new sub-menu to the <code>Navigation</code>
menu:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local waypoint_menu = Wheel.Item:new({
  name = "Select Waypoint",
  menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
    name = "Select Waypoint",
    items = {
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "TGT 1", action = "select_tgt_1" }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "TGT 2", action = "select_tgt_2" }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "Advanced", outer_menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
        name = "More Waypoints",
        items = {
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = "RTB", action = "select_rtb" }),
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = "Nearest Target", action = "select_tgt" }),
        },
      })}),
    }
  }),
})

Wheel.AddItem(waypoint_menu, {"Navigation"})
</code></pre>
<p>The info text of the menu can then be updated using</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local current_waypoint = "WP 2"
Wheel.SetMenuInfo(current_waypoint, {"Navigation", "Select Waypoint"})
</code></pre>
<p>To react to a selected action, listen to the corresponding event:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">ListenTo("select_tgt_1", function(task)
  -- Component interface
  task:Click("Nav Panel Function", "TARGET_1")

  -- or Raw interface
  task:Then(function()
    ClickRaw(
      devices.NavigationComputer_AN_ASN_46A,
      device_commands.RIO_NAV_COMP_FUNCTION_SELECTOR_KNOB,
      3,
      5
    ) -- Target 1
  end)
end)

<p>Jester Dialog consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua

<p>Opening <code>index.html</code> in a browser shows the dialog filled with example content.</p>
<p>The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS

<p>The UI logic, such as animations are defined in <code>renderer.js</code>, while the

<h2 id="lua-1"><a class="header" href="#lua-1">Lua</a></h2>
<p>Dialogs are shown on-demand and in-order. They are displayed for a certain time
and the user is given a chance to engage in the dialog or ignore it - upon which
it will expire and vanish.</p>
<p>A dialog consists of a question with up to 4 selectable options. An option is
either final or triggers a follow-up question with new options to select from.</p>
<p>Dialogs are hold and shown from a queue. A new dialog can be pushed to the queue
via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Dialog.Push(dialog)

<p>The following shows a simple example to add a new dialog:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="liveries"><a class="header" href="#liveries">Liveries</a></h1>
<p><em>"We got them in two-tone gray. We got them in two-tone green.
We can get them in hot fuchsia pink."</em></p>
<p>Creating Liveries for our F-4E can be tedious work.</p>
<p>Typically, the largest chunk of time goes into researching on the web and in
books to provide the most accurate, realistic Liveries.</p>
<p>With the release of the F-4E Phantom II, we want to see what you have in store
for the F-4. To support you in your creative ways of recreating your favorite
Livery, there is a few things to learn regarding the jet and how it is
represented in DCS.</p>
<h2 id="paintkit"><a class="header" href="#paintkit">Paintkit</a></h2>
<p><img src="dcs/modding/../../img/dcs_liveries_template.jpg" alt="dcs_liveries_template" /></p>
<p>The Paintkit has been created with ease of use in mind. It allows unwrapping the
3D Object onto a 2D space.</p>
<p>To provide the highest quality available, the Paintkit comes in <strong>Linear Color
Space</strong> and <strong>16 Bit Color depth</strong>. Bear in mind that not every Graphics Suite
will handle this correctly. The Paintkit was created using Adobe Photoshop.
Saving in 16 Bit Color depth will take a while, so be patient when hitting
<em>Save</em> in your Graphics Application.</p>
<p>The kit also provides a layer stack <em>Administrative Tools</em>, which also contains
the <em>Wireframe unwrap</em> helping to aligning your art.</p>
<p>The folder called <em>Partsfinder</em> helps identify pieces that belong together on
the <em>UV Unwrap</em> for certain parts. There is no padding applied there, so if you
use them for your selection, you might want to expand your selection by a few
pixels to get rid of artifacts on the seams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 You can link files in Photoshop. This means you can create art, save it as
a file and then link it in your Paintkit file. This makes for a non
destructive workflow which allows you to changes things afterwards if you are
not satisfied with your result.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pbr-rendering-and-roughmet-file"><a class="header" href="#pbr-rendering-and-roughmet-file">PBR Rendering and RoughMet File</a></h2>
<p>Next to your <em>Albedo File</em> which you create by exporting your custom Livery out
of the Paintkit, you will need the <em>RoughMet File</em> to make the most out of your
custom livery.</p>
<p>We provide you the uncompressed RoughMet files within the Paintkit files. DCS
uses <strong>Physical Based Rendering</strong> to create the picture you see on your monitor
or through your VR Headset.</p>
<p>The RoughMet files makes use of the three RGB Channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red -&gt; Ambient Occlusion (pre baked Shadows)</li>
<li>Blue -&gt; Metallic (Defines if a Surface is metallic or not)</li>
<li>Green -&gt; Roughness (is the Surface super smooth or really rough)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Roughmet File is in the <strong>8Bit RGB Range of Colors</strong>, per channel, you
get 255 Values to define the named attributes. Visually this is represented per
channel with a value of 0 for Black and a value of 255 for White.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/modding/../../img/dcs_liveries_material_error.jpg" alt="dcs_liveries_material_errors" /></p>
<h3 id="avoid-bright-or-dark-colors"><a class="header" href="#avoid-bright-or-dark-colors">Avoid bright or dark colors</a></h3>
<p>Together with what is defined in the RoughMet, the DCS engine renders the
picture. You must avoid using very bright or dark and 100% saturated Colors, as
otherwise that leads to DCS not being able to create proper effects when the
surface is hit by direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the engine can not render a color greater than the available
color space. So if you want a bright yellow marking on your jet, reduce the
saturation by around 15% as well as the brightness.</p>
<p>Ultimately you can check if your textures are withing the <strong>PBR Spectrum</strong> by
loading up your Custom Livery in the DCS <em>Modelviewer</em> and hit <kbd>F8</kbd>
which reveals the issue in the <strong>Material Errors View</strong>. If you see an orange or
magenta color here, it means that the Renderer cannot draw the full effects on
it since the base color (<strong>Albedo</strong>) is too bright or saturated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 There are many great sources out there to learn more about Physical Based
Rendering and you're always welcome to ask us directly in our
<a href="https://discord.com/servers/heatblur-simulations-1071433028045377637">Discord</a>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="character-customization"><a class="header" href="#character-customization">Character Customization</a></h2>
<p>The Phantom features <a href="dcs/modding/../character.html#customization">Character Customization</a>.</p>
<p>Until the feature and its UI is fully available at a later point during Early
Access, some of its features can already be accessed directly by modifying the
<code>description.lua</code> file of your Livery.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the area you need to look at:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">custom_args =
{
  [512] = 0.3, -- 0 is no mirrors, 0 - 0.4 is both mirrors (mickey mouse) and 0.5+ is top mirror only.
  [2008] = 0.95, --WSO Helmet, 0.95 is HGU-55
  [2006] = 0.95, --Pilot Helmet, 0.95 is HGU-55 (expand list of draw args)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Find the <code>custom_args</code> section which is usually towards the bottom of the file.
The numbers inside <code>[]</code> represents the <strong>Draw Argument</strong> used by DCS to tell the
model what your Pilot (and also the aircraft itself) wears.</p>
<p>Draw Argument <code>[512]</code> represents the <strong>Mirrors on the WSO Canopy</strong>. It can be
set to a value between 0.0 to 1.0, representing the animation range of the Draw
Argument.</p>
<p>This value is used to give your pilot a certain helmet, gloves or similar. Or
even to define the gender of the pilot model.</p>
<p><code>[2006]</code> is the Draw Argument for the Pilot Helmet. Set it to <code>0.1</code> and your
pilot will wear an old school HGU-2 helmet. Set it to <code>0.95</code> and he will be
wearing a more modern HGU-55.</p>
<h2 id="applying-custom-paints"><a class="header" href="#applying-custom-paints">Applying Custom Paints</a></h2>
<p>To apply a custom texture to the jet, copy an existing and replace the files
while keeping the names. You can find a small library of textures to cut down on
the overall size of a Livery in the <em>commons</em> folder under
<code>\CoreMods\aircraft\F-4E\Liveries\F-4E-45MC\commons</code>.</p>
<p>Trying to keep folder depth shallow this at first might look a bit messy but it
actually makes it easier to apply the texture in your <code>description.lua</code> and does
not bloat it too much with long folder paths.</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h3>
<p>The Folder <em>ALQ131_g</em> contains a Livery for the ALQ-131 Pod in Olive/Green
colors. You can tell your <code>description.lua</code> to use this texture instead of the
default white color from DCS when equipping the ALQ-131 to the Phantom in-game
by putting the following line of code into your <code>description.lua</code> file for both
the Albedo and the Roughmet Texture:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">{ "ALQ_131", 0, "../commons/alq131_g/alq_131_diff", false };
{ "ALQ_131", ROUGHNESS_METALLIC, "../commons/alq131_g/alq_131_diff_roughmet", false };
</code></pre>
<p>The first value after the <code>{</code> in Brackets <code>""</code> is the Material Name, in this
case the <code>"ALQ_131"</code>. It can be a bit tricky to find these Material names
through DCS. Feel free to ask in our
<a href="https://discord.com/servers/heatblur-simulations-1071433028045377637">Discord</a>
in the <strong>#liveries-lair</strong> channel for help on this.</p>
<p>Using the same principle, you can apply custom Flight Suit textures to your
Pilot as well as a HGU-2 Texture. Here is an example of a German Luftwaffe F-4F
Pilot and the WSO being equipped with German Luftwaffe Flight Suits and Grey
HGU-2 Helmets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">{ "PILOT_HGU-2_Helmet", 0, "../commons/HGU2_g/HGU-2_Helmet", false };
{ "PILOT_HB_Char_RobinOlds_CWU", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_cwu", false };
{ "PILOT_HB_Char_RobinOlds_overall", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall", false };

{ "WSO_HGU-2_Helmet", 0, "../commons/HGU2_g/HGU-2_Helmet", false };
{ "WSO_HB_Char_RobinOlds_CWU", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_cwu", false };
