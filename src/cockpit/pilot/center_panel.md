### Cabin Pressure Altimeter

![cabinpressure](../../img/cabinpressure.png)
Displays cabin pressure in 1,000-foot increments from 0 to 50,000 feet.

### Emergency Brake Pressure Indicator

![brakepressure](../../img/brakepressure.png)
Displays hydraulic pressure available from the emergency brake accumulators to the auxiliary and parking wheel brake systems.

| No. | Indicator       | Function                                                                                     |
|-----|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | PARK            | Shows brake pressure available for parking brakes. Green segment indicates 2,150 to 3,000 psi, red indicates 1,900 to 2,150 psi. When green there is pressure enough for approximately 3 applications. |
| 2   | AUX             | Shows brake pressure in the auxiliary brake pressure which can be used via the toe brakes on the pedals. Green segment indicates 2,150 to 3,000 psi (approximately 13 to 14 applications) while red indicates 1,900 to 2,150 psi (approximately 5 applications). |

### Control Stick

![stick](../../img/stick.png)
Used to control aircraft roll and pitch. Also various other functions according to table below.

| No. | Control                       | Function                                                                                     |
|-----|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Bomb release button           | Stores release button, used for air-to-ground ordnance (except rockets) and loaded external countermeasures. |
| 2   | Pitch and roll trim hat       | Hat used to control trim, up/down trims pitch and left/right trims roll.                      |
| 3   | Weapon select hat             | Selector hat moveable up and down and depressable. SP or PH - Selects AIM-7 or AIM-54, depression toggles between types. SW - Selects AIM-9, depression toggles between stations. GUN - Selects M-61A1 Vulcan gun. OFF - Inhibits weapon release. |
| 4   | DLC & maneuver flap command wheel | Thumbwheel used to control DLC or maneuver flaps. With DLC engaged forward rotation extends spoilers and aft rotation retracts spoilers. With flaps up and DLC disengaged forward rotation retracts maneuvering flaps/slats and aft rotation extends them. The logic behind the function being that pulling the wheel towards you increases lift and pushing it away decreases lift. |
| 5   | DLC engage/disengage & countermeasure dispense button | Momentary depression with flaps down, throttles less than MIL and no spoiler system failure engages DLC. With flaps up button sends command to ALE-39 to dispense chaff or flares according to RIO setting. DLC is disengaged by further momentary depression of the button, raising flaps, or advancing either throttle to MIL. |
| 6   | Autopilot reference & nosewheel steering button | Button toggling nosewheel steering with weight on wheels. Without weight on wheels is used to engage enabled autopilot modes. |
| 7   | Autopilot emergency disengage paddle | Disengages all autopilot modes and DLC and releases all autopilot switches and roll and pitch SAS switches to OFF position. With weight on wheels additionally reverts throttle mode to MAN (manual) while depressed. |
| 8   | Weapon firing trigger         | Two-stage trigger. First detent enables CTVS and gun camera. Second detent releases selected forwards firing weapon. |

**Note:** CTVS not implemented in DCS.
