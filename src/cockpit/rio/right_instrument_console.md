Indicator showing emitters detected by the ALR-67 RWR (radar warning receiver) set.

| No. | Control/Indicator          | Function                                                                                |
|-----|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | System status circle, area I | Upper left quadrant of 1. Shows symbol indicating the type of threats selected to be shown. N - Normal priority I - AI, airborne interceptors prioritized. A - AAA, anti-air artillery prioritized. U - Unknown emitters prioritized. F - Friendly emitters shown in addition to other threats. |
| 2   | System status circle, area II | Upper right quadrant of 1. Indicates if limited mode is selected. (Blank) - Limited mode not selected. L - Limited mode selected, display shows only 6 highest prioritized threats. |
| 3   | System status circle, area III | Lower half of 1. Displays failure codes and if offset display is selected. (Blank) - No failure detected and offset not selected. B - BIT failure. T - Thermal overload. O - Offset display selected. Threats will be separated to allow readout of overlapping symbols. Bearing accuracy degraded for displaced threats. |
| 4   | Non-lethal band            | Displays emitters not a direct threat to own aircraft, either because deemed out of range or lacking weaponry to do so. |
| 5   | Lethal band                | Displays threats that are deemed within range and capable of engaging own aircraft but not currently doing so. |
| 6   | Critical band              | Displays direct threats to own aircraft. Systems capable of engaging own aircraft and showing current intent of doing so. |
| 7   | INT knob                   | Intensity/brightness knob. Controls the brightness of the display.                       |

| 4   | XMIT                  | Advisory light indicating ALQ-126 is transmitting.                                         |
| 5   | SAM                   | Warning light, steady illumination when detecting lockon from a SAM tracking radar. Flashes when a missile launch is detected. |
| 6   | AAA                   | Warning light, steady illumination when detecting lockon from a AAA tracking radar. Flashes when AAA engagement is detected. |
| 7   | CW                    | Warning light indicating detection of a continuous wave emitter.                           |
