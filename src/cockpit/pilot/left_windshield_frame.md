# Left Windshield Frame

### Approach Indexer

![aoaindexer](../../img/aoaindexer.png)
Contains three lights showing angle-of-attack (AOA) relative to on-speed AOA.

Green being too slow, amber being on-speed AOA, and red being too fast.

If the HOOK BY-PASS switch is set to CARRIER, the lights will flash if the arresting hook is up while the landing gear is down.

These lights are repeated on the approach lights on the nosewheel strut, allowing the LSO to see aircraft AOA during carrier landings.
