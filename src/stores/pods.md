#### TACTS Pods
The TACTS pod is an analysis pod used during training missions, carried on LAU-7 rails instead of AIM-9s, normally on station 1A and 8A. They are normally carried as a pair of two, one on each side.

**Note:** In DCS, their functionality is purely cosmetic.

#### LANTIRN

The LANTIRN was adapted for use on the F-14 Tomcats during the 1990s as the F-14â€™s role started to gravitate towards including the precision strike role.

The version carried on the Heatblur DCS F-14B Tomcat represents the earliest integrations of the LANTIRN, the pod being carried only on station 8B and hardwired to the control panel in the RIO cockpit and to the video input on the TID/VDI.

For more information regarding the use of the LANTIRN pod, see the section about it under the General Design and Systems Overview chapter.
