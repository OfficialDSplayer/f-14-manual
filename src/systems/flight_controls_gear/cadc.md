# Central Air Data Computer (CADC)

The Central Air Data Computer or CADC is the computer acting as the spider in the web for most aircraft flight sensors and relaying this information to all systems needing them. In addition, it also controls the wing-sweep via the wing-sweep schedule and also controls the flaps and slats as they are limited by that same schedule.
