![altimeter](../../img/altimeter1.png)
Control and indicator for the servopneumatic altimeter.

| No. | Control/Indicator   | Function                                                                                      |
|-----|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Altimeter readout   | Displays altitude digitally on three drums showing 10,000, 1,000, and 100 of feet respectively. It also displays altitude on a pointer on a circular scale indicating 100’s of feet. |
| 2   | Baroset knob        | Sets local pressure in inches of mercury (in.Hg). Only used locally on the altimeter readout, all other digital indicators (via CADC) use a set 29.92 in.Hg value. |
