The ADM-141 tactical air-launched decoy (TALD) is a gliding decoy simulating real aircraft using active and passive means. There are several versions of the TALD, examples being a version equipped to launch chaff and another version using a Luneberg lens to increase its cross-section to simulate a larger aircraft.

All versions are pre-programmed before takeoff and are unpowered, gliding through the air on fold-out wings.

The F-14 can carry up to four ADM-141 TALDs, one each on stations 3 through 6, using a TER each to gain separation from the aircraft fuselage.

**Note:** In DCS these currently glide straight ahead until they run out of speed and altitude.
